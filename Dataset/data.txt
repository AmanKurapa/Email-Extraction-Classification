SMUD gave us their version of the ISDA agreement about 6 weeks ago and I am
still waiting for comments. I believe Susan Flynn is working on it and I
thought we would get comments by this past Monday. They want to start doing
financial gas and power swaps and I would really like to wrap up the legal
contract side of things. Can someone please call or email me and tell me the

Please find attached for your review, a Consent to Assignment Agreement

Carol is handling the consent for EPMI, and set forth below are her

Rhonda:
Enclosed is a clean and marked version of the MEGA Assignment. Is the plan
to confirm these trades under the existing Master with Morgan until a new EEI
Master is executed? What is the cutoff date for this assignment?

Carol,

Please review message below from Kristina Drew @ Merchant Energy. I thought
you would be the appropriate lawyer to work on this as it involves EPMI as
well as a derivative piece with ENA.

FYI: the assignment is not of immediate need, being that FERC approval must

If you do not think this to be the case, please advise as to who should work
on this matter.

Dear Paul,

I have just found out that we will be doing back to back trades for other

Japanese Enron company so we are negotiating it.

Dear Susan,

If we were to do any pulp or oil or lumber physical trading in Japan, should
this be done by Enron Japan Corp. or Enron Japan Marketing Corp. I am not
clear on whether it is only electricity or all physical trading which needs
to go through EJMC.

Thanks.

Sorry, a fairly basic question.

Background:

We have two legal entities here in Japan, Enron Japan Corp. ("EJC") and Enron
Japan Marketing Corp. ("EJMC"). EJMC is used just for physical trades for
reasons of US tax.

The draft ISDA schedule we are working on lists EJC as the Enron trading
entity. I am still checking how the lumber, oil and pulp trades will be
settled but even if they are all to be settled physically, at some stage we
may want to do financially settled trades with IBJ in which case EJC will be
the relevant entity.

Question:

If we will be using two Enron trading entities, do we need two ISDAs with the
counterparty?

Thanks.

Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently. I have

to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both
Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon. By the way, you and anyone
else in the group are always welcome to come out here!! I know that it is
far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.

How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group? How are you doing?
I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office. Charles is doing
great. He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches. He is growing
like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he
has started to sleep some more at night. We are slowly but surely getting
into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help. It's
hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by! Time flies when you are

Susan,

Thank you for the revised drafts. My comments are as follows:

(1) Please date the Master Agreement as of February 1, 2000.

(2) Part 1(a) -Specified Entities. As Enron Corp guarantees the performance of
Enron NAC's obligations under the Agreement, please add the words "Enron Corp,
but only to the extent that Enron Corp is a Credit Support Provider". This
seems
reasonable.

(3) Please re-number the pages so that the Schedule starts on page 19 and the
Paragraph 13 starts on page 11.

(4) Part 1(e) - Payments on Early Termination. I am checking with Tudor as to
whether they are agreeable to Loss for trades going out beyond two years. I
would say, however, that I am not aware that they have agreed to this with any
other counterparty. That said, Per's point that the trades are much shorter
than
this is noted.

(5) Part 2(b) - Payee tax reps. Ospraie never makes payee tax reps other than
relating to its place of incorporation. If this is an important point for
you,
I will get out tax group involved. However, Tudor prefers that neither party
makes payee tax reps.

(6) Part 3(b) - Documents to be Delivered. Party B annual financials - should
read "... 120 days after the end of its fiscal year".

(7) Part 3(b) - legal opinion. Please confirm that you will pay the costs of
Cayman counsel.

(8) Part 4(h) - Jurisdiction. I am checking with Tudor as "any court" is much
broader than the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the NY courts.

(9) Part 5(b)(g) - Commercial User rep. Tudor cannot make this rep. Please
replace with the following: "Party A represents, with respect to Options, that
it is a producer, processor, commercial user of, or merchant handling, the
commodity subject to the Transaction or the products or byproducts thereof,
and
is entering into each Option Transaction solely for purposes related to its
business as such".

(10) Part 5(f) - Procedures for Entering into Transactions. Please remove the
word "deemed" in the last line. This is no longer relevant.

(11) Part 5(i). I am checking with Tudor. Is the "no consequential damages"
consistent with Part 7 which expressly provides for the payment of out of
pocket
expenses, the costs of a delta hedge etc. on non-payment of premium in a
currency option?

(12) Part 5(k) - Transfer. For the part of the paragraph relating to Party A,
please change the proviso to read "and provided that such transfer will not
give
rise to adverse tax consequences to Party B or to a Termination Event or an
Event of Default, and the proposed transfer would not adversely affect Party
B's
existing netting or set-off rights or under applicable law". The part of the
paragraph relating to Party B should provide: "Party B may transfer its rights
and obligations under this Agreement with the prior written consent of Party
A,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld." These amendments are intended
to
be reasonable and fair to both sides.

(13) Part 6 - line 2 "Definitions" - typo.

(14) Part 7(b) - please remove the reference to "ISDA". The FX Definitions are
previously defined in Part 5(e).

(15) Para 13(b)(ii). Please include longer term Treasuries. My understanding
is
that this is what has been agreed, but please let me know if this is not your
understanding and I will check with Tudor.

(16) Para 13 (b)(iii). Please remove the reference to L/Cs.

(17) Para 13(d) - Specified Condition (Tax Event) should refer to Section
6(b)(ii) and Specified Condition (TEUM) should refer to Section 6(b)(iii).

(18) Para 13(g). I will check with Tudor.

(19) Para 13(g). I think references to "Downgraded Party" and "Credit Rating
Event" are inappropriate. Please clarify. Is there any way you will agree to
the
provisions of Paragraph 6(c) without more? What seems to be important is that
the Secured Party is not a Defaulting Party - i.e. Para 13(g)(i)(1) (not (2)).
This is consistent with Para 6(c) of the pre-printed form. Para 13(h) is
related
to this issue.

(20) Para 13(i) and (j) - please remove. L/C-related provisions are no longer
relevant.

I look forward to receving revised drafts of the Schedule, Paragraph 13 and
guarantee in due course.

Kind regards.

HEADER_CONTENT It seems that there are only a few issues for me to respond as to and these
are below. You can handle the rest, I think. Also, he jumped on the L/C
removal language that we discussed.

[references are to numbered paragraphs below]
(2) OK
(5) Did you ever receive a response from Rhett?
(7) Per already responded to you. Please find out if CP has Cayman counsel.
(11) These are two separate issues. Short of a conversation, it sounds like
he is confusing payments on Early Termination with consequential damages.
The former will capture unpaid premiums in the event of an Early Termination
based upon failure to pay.
(12) Need to be consistent for both parties.
(14) Is he right?
(15) Verify with Rod.
(17) I think I reviewed this point already, didn't I?
(19) Check with Rod and I'll also review.

Sara -- As discussed last Friday, attached is the referenced agreement

used for trading wholesale power with counterparties who have not executed a
master agreement or other sort of enabling agreement with EPMI. The latter

George,
I'm not sure if you're the right person to send the comments to, but Media
General has the following comments on the Newsprint Swap Agreement.

Schedule to Master Agreement

1. Media General wants the cross-default to be reciprocal at $100 million
for both Media General and Enron.
2.  Further, Media General thinks that this should be a cross-acceleration,
not a cross-default.
3.  Page 3 of Schedule. The "date by which to be delivered" for Party B
should track the same with Party A: i.e., if financials are available on
EDGAR then they would not be automatically provided by MG on a quarterly
basis.
4. Page 4 of Schedule. Under (a), add "Attn.: Chief Financial Officer".
We will send Marshall Morton's fax and telephone numbers.
5. We will let you know who will serve as process agent. We would like to
talk about governing law in Texas and the site of arbitration in Houston.
6. Page 6 of Schedule. In clause(b)(g), please note that MG intends to
assign this agreement and we want to make sure that does not affect this
representation.
7.Page 8 of Schedule. MG wants the right to assign this agreement to a
party with a credit agreement equivalent to a certain level. We can discuss
what that level should be. We should discuss what Enron's credit rating is
in this connection.

Transaction Confirmation Document.

1. MG does not think this transaction should be characterized as a
"swaption". This was to be a deal for the purchase of newsprint at a fixed
price, not at Enron's option.
2. We want todiscuss the expiration date. We should also discuss the other
dates and terms which are blank. On page 2, under "Additional Provisions",
the date for satisfying conditions is clearly wrong since it refers to July
5. Once again, all of this ties in with not being an option, but a fixed
agreement.
3. We would like to have Enron render a monthly settlement statement with a
net amount being paidto/receivable from MG. No netting is presently
provided for in the agreement.


ISDA Credit Support Annex

MG would like to delete this entirely and would propose that Enron would
rely on the general cross-acceleration provisions. Media General never
contemplated credit provisions more onerous than its credit agreements.

I will have the Media General business people follow up with the
people at Enron, but could you please have some one get in touch with me on
this.

Attached below please find subuser passwords for DynegyDirect so that each of
you can review relevant products before we let the traders loose. Sara, Greg
Whalley and Andy Zipper just called me and are very anxious to get sign off
to trade financial products. Marcus, Wade Hicks called me and is anxious to
trade LPG products. We have a financial contract in place with Dynegy which
will govern financial transactions, so it's just a matter of approving the
products. However, we do not have a liquids contract in place so you,
Marcus, need to sign off on the Dynegydirect on-line terms and conditions
that I sent you before we can commence trading.

If you have trouble logging on, give Sheri Thomas a call -- she has already
logged on to use the system. I believe you are going to need to download
some software to use the system.

Please let me know AS SOON as you have completed your review so that we can

Dear Sara,

Further to our conversation of this morning, I have spoken to our
Credit Manager, Andrzej Kabarowski. We are able to significantly
move negotiations forward by agreeing to your proposed $100MM
Cross-Default Thresholds for Cargill-Alliant and Enron North America
Corp. I can also agree to your language and a trigger of BELOW BBB-
for the Additional Event of Default.

Regarding the Set-Off issue, I attach language for your consideration
which demonstrates our agreement to include a Non-Defaulting Party's
Affiliates. This language does not, however, make Set-Off available
in all instances, but rather restricts it to the market standard of
set-off in cases of any Event of Default and the Credit Event Upon
Merger Termination Event. In light of our agreement to the 3 major
items above, we ask that you consider using the attached language in
this ISDA Master Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and
Cargill-Alliant LLC.

Unfortunately, I still have no further information on the Guarantee
from Cargill, Incorporated. We have again pressed our Corporate
Treasury Dept. for a prompt response.

I look forward to hearing from you again at your earliest convenience.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA. She informs me that SITA does
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations

Sara

I am not sure I understand the question. What do you mean by RMT?

Here is an explanation of what happened here in London:

Due to cash flows originated by tax in London before year end, some Enron
Europe companies had FX positions that needed to be hedged. However, due to
tax reasons we could not hedge the FX positions in the entities in which they
arose because the hedge gains or losses would be subject to the 'sub-part F'
income rules (and liable to double tax).

Tax therefore suggested that we transact the hedges in the name of 'ECT
Europe Accounting Entity' (company 912), where they would be consolidated
into Enron Europe for management accounting but would be within a US legal
entity and therefore not subject to double tax. My understanding is that 912
is a branch of ENA and therefore there is a hedge transacted between ENA 912
and ENA.

We have been trying to identify the hedges within company 912 but cannot see
them there. Can you help with this?

Regards

Peter

HEADER_KEYWORDS brazil limitada tax trading ect
HEADER_SUBJECT Re: Products for Trading in Brazil.
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Gary and Joe,

We should probably have a conference call sometime next week to discuss how
we want to proceed on the financial derivatives/trading side. I have a
number of concerns which I share here.

First, we do not have a tax-efficient entity in which to trade. If we set up
a Brazilian limitada solely for the purpose of trading, and we lose money, we
will generate Brazil tax credits. Enron already has at least $25M of these
credits and I think we want to try to limit the possibility of generating
additional credits going forward. In addition, there is a possibility that
Enron Corp. may begin limiting the utilization of these credits, so one might
end up with minimal tax benefit if there was a loss (creating an asymetrical
trading payoff). I was hoping we could trade out of Elektro, but Lynn
informs me that any gains in Elektro will be subject to both US and Brazil
taxation.

Second, to the extent that we do take tax risk in a limitada, we still need
to fund (and possibly) guarantee the limitada. Currently, the only way to
fund the limitada without being exposed to a whole host of tax/FX issues is
through equity. However, equity is difficult to repatriate (it would be
repatriated probably only as far as Cayman for tax reasons) and we are
subject to convertibility risk. In addition, earnings in the company could
most likely only be repatriated via shareholder loans (dividends would be
subject to US tax), meaning that the cash would have to come back into Brazil
when the loan expired (and then it would be sent back out if there was no
convertibility event).

Third, trading stocks on the Bovespa may create Chinese Wall issues with
regards to our ongoing M&A and Financing activities. In all likelihood, one
would be trading energy/telecom stocks. Those companies are also the ones
with which the ESA origination teams are trying to do business. We might be
able to create a Chinese Wall, but given the size of the ESA office (not big)
and the limited scope of our intended trading operation, we have to consider
whether it is worth potnetially limiting those core activities to spec. trade
(or consider what cost would be incurred to ceate a Chinese Wall).

The other two products--money markets and futures--can be traded (albeit in a
more limited fashion) offshore.  Because money market instruments can't be
shorted locally, they are really just passive investment vehicles (like a
bank CD) off of which one trades the interest rate via swaps. That is, you
are shortening or lengthening your investment horizon based on one's
expectation of rates and continually earning either a higher or lower carry
than market. Most of this type of trading can be done offshore through
credit-linked notes (including R$ CDI, R$ prefixed and USD fixed) and
short-term Brazil Bradys. Currency futures of course can be traded via NDFs.

In sum, I think we need to better define the type of trades we will do and
where we are going to do those trades. My hope is that we can define a
couple of products/ideas we want to implement now and then figure out in
which entity to house that activity.

I will try to set up a conference call for next week on this topic.

Regards, Bruce

The rates from JP Morgan for the Futures account appear to be competitive
(acutally better) than the terms for our other current agreements.
With 90 day t bill at 4.41%, 90% of this is 3.969% on the credit side vs 4.16
using JP morgan's less 25 bp.
On the debit side it is competitive.
Therefore, I am okay with the rate schedule from JP morgan and we can go

We bought the Genesys shares before the IPO. It was a private placement. I
suspect that someone in India will have the initial offering if that will
help you any. Let me know if you want me to run it down.

I wil have to get back with you on the symbol for Rediff.com.

Lauren,
Was a FIP (Foreign Investor Proposal) obtained in order for us to buy the
shares in the IPO? If the Mauritiurs entity was authorized to obtain the
shares through the IPO, doesn't it then make sense that we can sell the
shares?
Please let me know your thoughts.

Subject: Re: RMT Masters - booking trades

Hopefully, none of these transactions have been "booked" for ENA by a trader
located in a foreign country. That said, the general rule is that
intra-company transactions are generally booked directly to RMT rather than
to ENA and then back to RMT. I have cc'd Rhett Jackson on my reply so that
he can confirm this since Rhett has become the "keeper" of the RMT technology
for our group. Sorry for the delay in responding. Steve.

If you are in agreement with the language, please forward Enron's proposed
language (detailed in your 2/26 fax) electronically (if available).

Thank you and Regards,

Currently, we have three ISDA Master Agreements under process. Our potential
counterparties are Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., The Industrial Bank
of Japan and Sanwa Bank Ltd. We have produced these documents based on the
credit worksheets prepared in Houston and in conjunction with Baker &
McKenzie, Tokyo. Mark Taylor is reviewing the drafts prior to presenting
them to the potential counterparties.

I am not aware of any brokerage arrangements to which Enron Japan Corp. is a
party. I note that I have copied Jonathan Whitehead on this correspondence,
as he may be able to provide insight regarding plans for entering into such
arrangements.

Best regards,

John

Thanks for your response John, I think it provides the clarification that we
need to move forward.
I have one further question for you relating to current ISDA/exchange
agreements that we have in place in Enron Japan.

Below are all exisiting ISDA and brokerage agreements that Financial trading
currently has in place. Does Enron Japan have any ISDA/broker agreements in
place that we can use for the purpose of executing financial trades?
(perhaps with some of the names on the attached list?)If so, do you know what
sort of credit has been extended and/or whether there is netting versus other
commodity books or dedicated activity credit?

If we do not have any agreements in place which would allow us to conduct
trades, do you know who I should contact regarding necessary documentation?

Sincerely,
Darren

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Mike Billings has given us your name as the first contact person in Enron
to negotiate an ISDA agreement with The Dow Chemical Company (TDCC). Our
files show an ISDA between Enron Capital & Trade Resources and two Dow
entities (Dow Hydrocarbons & Resources, and Dow Chemical Canada). In
addition to this, my understanding is that TDCC (my predecessor in this
position) and Enron ( presumably a lawyer) had some discussions about an
ISDA, but for some reason they were not successful. Despite this, the
level of trading between the two companies have increased and TDCC has
never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included in the
confirmations sent by Enron. For these reasons, we think we should agree
on an ISDA where conditions acceptable to both parties can apply to the
intense trading between the two companies.
In order to speed up the process, I have enclosed to this message Dow's
template for the ISDA Schedule. We would appreciate if Enron could review
the attached draft and come back with any comments or issues for
discussion. Please forward this message to the responsible person asking
him to contact me for any discussion. Thanks.

Gentlemen:

Several points regarding the below:

We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement
with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC
wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all). Rod Nelson was
the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time.
If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact
someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for a
master agreement. Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone
in my group to get that process started.
The e-mail from Dow indicates:
"TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included
in the
confirmations sent by Enron."
All credit concerns aside, if Dow is not signing and returning our
confirmations, then based on this statement our derivatives trading with them
should stop immediately on legal grounds.
The e-mail as forwarded to me did not contain the attachment. Does someone
here have it?

Let's hope it works out better this time.

Mark

Gary,

I haven't been able to get a hold of you the last couple of days and there
are a
few things I wanted to discuss.

1. If you don't have a problem I am proposing to put in place an execution
agreement with ABN Amro Futures who will give up to Commonwealth Bank on
behalf
of Carr. I have already put the steps in motion for this to occur through
Shari
Stack.

2. I would like to put in place an ISDA between ENA and Commonwealth Bank as I
have been talking to their FX desk and would like to be in the position of
being
able to trade with them. I will talk to Credit about it if you don't have a
problem.

3. The laywer here told me the other day that we have not signed an ISDA with
Westpac because of a disagreement over guarantees. Apparently Westpac have
been
hard to deal with through the whole process although all other issues have
been
signed off. When the FX contact came here for a meeting yesterday I told him
that I wouldn't be dealing with them until the ISDA was sorted out and he said
that Houston is dealing without an ISDA so I should. My concern is that while
we
are dealing with them there is no pressure on them to sort out the ISDA.


I sent a book to Clara about Australian financial markets and included in the
package a surf lifesaving cap because I had heard you wanted one. It is the
competition cap of Memaid Beach Surf Lifesaving Club.

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers. The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume
of
the increase. That is an estimate. Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you.

Hi. Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st. I had requested 145 dth per day on
Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler. For some reason Chris
Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth. PSNC
called
me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled. I instructed PSNC to
contact Chris. Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth
on
the first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second. I did this.
This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March
1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed. I called my transco scheduler and
she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled.
(impossible as capacity was released to Enron). All I wanted was 145 dth per
day for March. Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what should
and did get scheduled? Thank you.

Subject: TRANSCO PROPRIETARY FILE

Dave,

As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES
contracts as well
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union. Our proprietary file contacts the
business party id, rather
than the DUNS number. Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's
business party id. These
are the valid business parties we use:

ENA  5304
Brooklyn Union  21995
Columbia Energy Services 5092
Columbia Energy Marketing 7772

As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various
producers, we will
need to include their business parties as well. For now, this is all we
need. In the meantime,
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert
into Unify as do not
send??

Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking. We spend a
great deal of time
overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity to
be cut as we need
it. Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swing
activity to 899??

Thanks for you help.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Need your assistance.  Obviously I need your expertise on Tennessee (and
someone's on Transco).  We need to get gas to S. Ct. and Ct. Natural
citygates
for February.

Here's a what if...........I just spoke with a Tennessee rep to ask about
Transco Rivervale and Tennessee.  They are currently allowing short hauls at
this point.   However, could we bring in some Transco at Rivervale and do a
short haul on Tennessee Mawaw (spelling)?  As of today I was told it could
flow to the above citygate meters.  (although this could change overnight).
I know we did this a few times last winter also.

How does Transco look for this?  As you can tell I am not even aware of the
economics.  If this would work what would it cost? Can you check with Chris
(I don't know his e-mail address)?

HEADER_CONTENT cc:

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2: The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue. Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3. Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.  Here is what is happening: Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.  We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers. So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items. That's problem one. Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations. We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want). For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.  I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4. Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you. Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges. This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. Let us know what
you would prefer. Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29. Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7. I apologize for the delay.

5. Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday. Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
balances.

HEADER_CONTENT Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240)
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had to tranfer the
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at
Friday's P&L. This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday resulting in taking the
Sunday's gain away from your book.

Let me know if we need to discuss further. thanks.

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible. For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it. I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one). Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up. I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please
advise.

HEADER_SUBJECT GELP, additional information
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT First, I wanted to follow up yesterday's question on GELP meter reading and
how
Enron gets this information in the future. I can't provide a direct answer to
this question, but can provide a contact at Columbia Gas of Virginia to
discuss
the situation.  Lisa Jesse is the Industrial Account Rep. (at 804-323-5343)
and quite familiar with GELP. I am making her aware of the transition and
will
briefly discuss the options available. You should probably make contact for
more relating to LDC information and equipment.

Also, I wanted to forward some examples of the fuel oil information we handle.
The "02 2000 GELP BY VENDOR" and "1999_2000 Winter Oil Orders" will give you
an
idea of where we actually stand as of this morning and where I am in the
February tracking process. On the "02 2000 GELP BY VENDOR" attachment you
will
see delivery by delivery, plant Vs BOL (transporter delivery tickets) and a
summary sheet that identifies any discrepancies fairly quickly. We are
provided the actual delivery tickets via mail, from the Plant (weekly), and
maintain those records. The paragraph below is basically a repeat from the
original note, but I wanted to make sure the information wasn't missed.



We are responsible for the procurement, coordination and tracking of their
fuel
oil activities through the winter period. We've relied on CITGO, BPAmoco and
Marathon Ashland to provide the bulk of our oil supplies in the past. The
only
means of transporting oil to this facility is truck and the above suppliers
have been good about coordinating delivery to the facility. GELP has a 5
million gallon oil tank on site and need to maintain 4.5 million gallons of
inventory through the winter period (FLASH... due to oil prices and
availability, this is under consideration). The Plant has very specific
requirements prior to accepting delivery from any supplier... they demand a
specific 'Sulfur content' test (ASTM D-2622 test) be performed, sent, and
approved by Plant personnel prior to allowing any transporters into their
facility. I have also included basic fax covers sent during this process
including the actual confirmation of placing the order, having the appropriate
oil testing and then faxing the test results to the Plant upon receiving them
from suppliers.

Again, let us know if you need anything further. Thanks.

HEADER_CONTENT Attached is additional information from CES regarding administration of the
GELP deal. They have given us the contact at CGV to discuss the meter
reading process--Joan, can you follow up with CGV to find out how this is
going to work? Also, Kim saved these documents in the same directory that
Joan put all the last documents in (in the GELP directory) and she has also
printed them out. If you want hard copies, just ask her. Just for the
record, the good news is that the winter is almost over and that seems to be
when most of the work under this contract occurs--once the summer is here
there is a back to back deal with Duke for gas supplies. The other good news
is that it looks like you all will get the opportunity to learn quite a bit
about fuel oil. The bad news is that there doesn't seem to be too much up
side in this deal. The $5,000 monthly fee is about all you get unless you
can get gas to them between November and February and receive your $.05 fee
on that volume.

Anyway, CES is planning on our taking over both the GELP and CALP contracts
the first week of March. This will give us 3 weeks of administering it and
asking all of our questions before the CES contacts are no longer there.
This means we need to very quickly decide who is going to prepare which
reports, how exactly we will handle the fuel oil deliveries (will the gas or
fuel oil guys handle this?), meter reading, contact lists, etc,  I realize
it is bid week and very difficult to get you all together, but I'd like to
have a quick meeting on Monday, February 28 at 11:00 am in Room 3125B to
discuss the GELP and CALP contracts. Please let me know if you cannot make

you let me know if this correct. Should Enron be charging demand charges?
Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal. However, I am not sure if
that is correct. Please let me know if you are not the correct person to
send this note too.
Thank you for your help!

Subject: CKY 6-12 January 2000 - cut 29th 767 dth

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.  However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.  They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.   When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.  I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.  I
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.  I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.  I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.  She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.  She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).  I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.  However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.  I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short, we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).  Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k. How does the grass look up at
Dad's. I am thinking we should maybe bale the hay. I have intentions of
going up there this coming weekend. You should have bought a boat during
the boat show. I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him
about a boat. Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat? Freshwater or
Saltwater. I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha. A friend of mine
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston
Whaler. I think the boat was around 21/23 '. The sides were approximately
6/8" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directly
behind that which served as a seat. It also had what I call a jack plate on
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom. He
could run in about 8" of h2o. If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150
horse Yamaha. That baby would fly. They are bay boats but Aubrey took his
out in the Gulf frequently. You should call Duane Davis. I bet he can find
you exactly what you want.

Buddy, did the Easter Bunny come to see you?

Be Safe!

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type. Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

way down to invoices.

If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities
are the same now. In Jan, the "true backhaul" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was
$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges. We actually did
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until
October, after the summer period?

According to CES, Sitara #146788 is an exchange deal and the rate should be

Could you please add this fee to the said sitara # ? Please let me know if

HEADER_CONTENT In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John
Singer). Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

HEADER_CONTENT Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total
daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day. This would
be
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing
gas.  On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1,
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31. Otherwise, we could be liable
for
penalties.  Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary
and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further.

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers. The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume
of
the increase. That is an estimate. Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I received a call this afternoon from the VNG - TCO Account Manager. VNG
incurred pipeline overrun charges from Nov 17th - 21st. TCO stated ENA used
VNG capacity to deliver to other markets {Hopewell Power Plant}. TCO
notified Enron and VNG of the allocation problem during the month of
November, 2000. Although TCO assured Enron that the predetermined allocation
methodology would be corrected to allow VNG rights to pull under the contract
first, however, based on the conversation with TCO, corrections were not
made. Therefore, VNG incurred overrun charges under the VNG contract @
$10.00/dth totaling $560,000+.

Please notify pipeline to reconcile and provide AGLES with pipeline invoices
for November, 2000. ENA is responsible for all penalties associated with
this transaction.

****************
1) Enron NA was never notified by TCO of any penalty, overrun on VNG contract
or pipeline OFO situation during the November 18-21 time period.

2) Denise Dotson was notified by VNG gas control on the morning of November
20th about the overrun situation above. The VNG gas control experienced the
problem but did not notify Enron or AGL until Monday morning.

3) Enron immediately placed ranking system in Navigator to make VNG first
priority. This was completed Monday afternoon November 20th.

4) On Tuesday morning 11/21, Denise Dotson once again called Enron stating
that the previous night VNG attempted to pull maximum volumes from  storage
contracts only to overrun contract due to ENA nominations to other delivery
points. Joann Collins called her Columbia team and was told that the
ranking was not applicable after the last confirmation cycle on any gas day
with no-notice contracts. Ranking has zero effect with the late night
schedulers.

Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport. We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered) NIMO would not allow us
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

How much of the NIMO capacity (about 15,000 day of North to North) was
dedicated
to retail?

From what I'm seeing, the retail volumes are looking fairly small.

When I was younger I hated going to weddings ...it seemed that all of my

Technology has helped Enron create new businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com. You =01,ve seen what technology can do at work. Now we want you and your family to realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t he ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips.
We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000 software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries; however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT , Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business reasons. Eligibility includes being employed at the time of implementation. ? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter. Delive ry of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized. To address some of your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on http://clickathome.enron.com. We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne ar future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.
We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your family. We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve l by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe Enron is a great place to work.

HEADER_CONTENT Actually, prior to the CES acquisition we had between 200 and 500 little
wells of metered production in the Appalachian area of our own. These wells
produce anywhere from 10 dt's to 10,000 dt's per day. Most are very minimal,
probably 500 dt's or less. This production is produced on several gathering
lines off of CNG and Columbia Gas. A couple of years ago Columbia Gas
started getting out of the gathering business and sold part of the wells to
Gatherco, then they spun off part to CNR, and the remainder are still held by
Columbia Gas. Around the 10th of the month we get estimates from Gatherco
and CNR as to what it appears that the individual wells are producing and
then we nominate the gas, which takes up to several hours of updating time.
The Columbia Gas meters we do not have to individually nominate to the pipe.
We receive an estimate from the pipe for the total volume and they give us
credit for it in our pool. Sounds simple. The problem comes three months
down the road when we get the actuals from Columbia Gas as to what flowed at
these meters and accounting has to go in and make payments to all these
little producers.

Prior to unify, it didn't really effect us. Client Services would just zero
out the one lump estimate that we had made and then they would go in and add
each producer, the wells that flowed, the volume and make the final payment
to each. It was a very time consuming process and they had one person who
was solely devoted to doing nothing but this. Because unify was developed to
put as much work up front in the process, client services no longer has the
'back door' to get the payment out the door. This means that each well that
we have on Columbia Gas must now have an individual ticket in sitara with a
volume of 0 (currently our responsibility to set up) and must have at least
one path with a volume of 1 for each month in unify. Several months ago
after converting to unify, Robert, Molly Lafuze, Kathy Moore, and Victor put
in a massive effort over the course of about three weeks to get all of our
own meters taken care of while still maintaining their respective jobs.
Generally, it's the same meters that flow and when we set them up, we do it
over a long period of time so the path just rolls from one month to next and
as long as we keep up our tracking and balancing, we're just in maintenance
mode. However, sometimes new wells come up, at which point the process is to
1) have the global group set up the meters and the counterparties, 2) set up
a deal in sitara, 3) put a path in unify with a volume of 1, 4) create noms,
and 5) track and balance. Since we don't even get actuals to 3 months after
flow, we usually have at least 3 to 4 months of catch up to do. And of
course, as you are aware, our systems have been running a little slow lately.

With the acquisition of CES we have taken on even more of the gas. I've
heard on a couple of occasions just how many wells this is, but I'm sorry,
the number seems to have escaped me. I know it is at least several hundred
and that it is quit a bit more than we had previously.

This whole subject is one that has been passed around by several people
including myself, Chris Germany, John Singer, Jim Javins, and Scott Neal on
more than one occasion. One thought that John Singer and Jim Javins had was
to have someone named Hiedi in Jim's office get access to our systems and
input the gas herself. Seems like a nice suggestion, except that she is EES
and I don't think that we want her in our sytems. By the way, John Singer
and Jim Javins are the ones buying this wellhead gas. They picked Hiedi
because she works in the same office as Jim and they feel that she could give
these little guys the hand holding treatment that they sometimes demand.
Yes, it's hard to believe but it's the ones getting the $50 checks that
complain the most. They thought that Hiedi could also be responsible for
making the payments.

Anyway, that suggestion wasn't really panning out, so another suggestion has
arisen as to setting up a whole new Enron entity that would handle the
metered supply and we would be buying the gas from this entity. First, we
would have to take into consideration whether it would restrict our
flexibility on Columbia Gas.  I'm not totally sure how to go about getting
something like this off the ground, but it does have merit. Another thought
was to hire someone here that's sole responsibility would be the metered
supply. They would hopefully become a specialist in the area and would work
closely with Gloria in client services, Jim Javins and John Singer. The
thought was to have them report either to me or to Scott Neal. Chris and I
tend to disagree in this area. he thinks there is plenty of work for a full
time person. My opinion is that there is definitely a need for a special
project over the course of some time, but that once the initial push to get
the meters in is done that it is more of a part-time responsibility. The big
problem with that though is right now, the guys downstairs don't even have
time to get these special type of requests done and it might be faster for
Gloria to do them herself, if she has proper training and access to our
systems. However, regardless of which group gets the responsibility, there
is going to be a need for a very large effort within the next month or so
when January actuals come in and we should be prepared.

Any way, please give it some thought and let me know if you have any
suggestions. I'd also like to here what your views might be.

Thanks!

Bob,

After talking with Robert about this request this morning, I told him that I
would look at future option, but that in the meantime I would go ahead and
take care of these for Gloria. Well, to my shock, it took over three hours
for me to complete the task of setting up 2 deal in sitara and adding and
pathing 9 meters in unify over the course of six months. I'm not sure why I
thought this, but I thought it might take 30 maybe 45 minutes. The whole
process is really rather simple, just very time consuming. What scares me is
that we are soon going to be having to do exactly this same thing for the
hundreds of metered production wells that have come over with the CES
acquisition. At the current rate of business that we are doing, I just don't
see how will be able to accomplish this with our current resources.

We still have some time before we need to make a decision, but a couple of
possible solutions would be 1) bring in some temporary help for a short
period of time or 2) give Gloria access to help out with this, but then we
give up part of the control of our systems to other group.

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999. (Applause
here!) Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled via a manual line item.

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type. For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity. Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting. Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close. The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31. This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara. Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month. For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator. They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
forward.

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting... Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1. We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for
production months older than 12/1999. This allows us to focus our efforts on
current month. Per Bryce, applaud here!

2. Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3. Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4. Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator. Changes should be made
effective 12/1999 production forward.

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions. If
necessary, please forward to your teams.

The offsetting dollar amount for the 9612 production adjustment
(K#016-21045-306C) was $121,080.16. This adjustment however was reversed
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in
11/97 GL and subsequently written off in 01/98 GL at the time the company was
sold. I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it.

I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we are
going to make to Co.366 ($463,609.20) and the actual dollars in the system
($498,824.82). He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct.

Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what
the amount would be. Thanks,

Subject: Enron Louisiana Mtg. 8/3

I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday. Tracy is expecting
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production
month adjustment. What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2) pass it through to
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3)
cut a check to Trans Canada? Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00? I believe it depends on
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

I really don't want to go down the road of putting together any more side
letter agreements. They are too time consuming. I really feel that we
should have no problem forwarding to you our electronic communications with
ENA confirming the storage volume. You can use this as a basis to complete
your billing reconciliations. I will promise to forward to you all of the
volume confirmations that we have with ENA for July 31 injections.

Colleen;
I don't have your view. If you want to do a side letter, as was completed
for the hedges, let us know. However, if you all don't feel strongly about
this, then I am inclined to carry on as I described above.

Subject: Post-Close Storage Settlement


Tim--With regard to the Post-Close Storage Settlement between NPC and CES, the
situation is that we are waiting on final, correct invoices from ENA showing
the volumes injected for the 4 theoretical storages (TCO, Transco WSS, Transco
ESS, and Sonat CSS).  We would also like ENA to agree in some written format
as to the July 31 volumes in each of these storages, where these volumes
reflect the April 1 starting inventory that was left over from last winter.
If
these final numbers from ENA agree with the values that Jeff Porter put in the
latest version of the storage exhibit to the purchase agreement, that is
fine.  To the extent that ENA has invoiced CES for a different amount(s), CES
will resolve those differences with ENA. (We know that there are some
differences, as shown in the attached spreadsheet.)

I have asked Chris Germany at ENA to work with us to get this resolved, and he
has agreed to do so. However, it might help expedite things if you can weigh
in with Chris or with Colleen Sullivan as well.  Please let me know if you
have questions, etc. I am going to be out of the office for at least the next
few days, but I will be checking my e-mail and voice messages periodically.

or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like

Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

HEADER_CONTENT In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John
Singer). Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Okay.... to ensure we are all on the same page. We will try to hit your
48,000/day for the last 6 days. The nom's were redone for 2/24.

Because choice burns are so low... I'll nominate about 33,000/day of the
choice burn directly from storage. Joann Collins will use about 15,000/day
to other CES Enduser Market. Just remember, we are at the mercy of mother
nature. When the actuals arrive.... we balance off storage. So if it gets
colder than the forecast, the storage withdrawal will increase. If it gets
warmer, the storage withdrawal will decrease.

If for some reason you want to change this 48,000/day target... just let me
know by 10 EST. This will allow enough time to switch the nom's.

Dick Jenkins and Chris Germany will review if they want "CES to sell back
flowing gas to Enron in order to maintain the storage withdrawal at this
level." (quoted from your other e-mail).

Do you know your March target number for storage withdrawal??? I can
provide your storage balance if needed. Remember, that operationally.... I
use the storage to keep your choice burn balanced with choice actuals.

Chesapeake Energy stock being sorely undervalued
2001-02-25
By Melissa Davis
Business Writer

Ask the experts. Chesapeake Energy is more than a $9 stock.
Forget that Chesapeake is up more than 200 percent from a year ago -- and up
more than 1,000 percent from its lowest days, not long ago, when it traded
for less than $1. Chesapeake still appears sorely undervalued.
Last week, Chesapeake announced record fourth-quarter earnings that were
1,736 percent higher than earnings for the same quarter in 1999. The company
also reported a 2000 net income of $3.52 a share -- which means you can buy
Chesapeake for a price that is less than three times the company's earnings.
"No stock trades for three times earnings," said Mickey Thompson, executive
vice president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. "The
independent producers are all undervalued right now. Chesapeake is just the
most undervalued."
Chesapeake is the 10th-largest independent producer of natural gas in the
country. And natural gas, because of low supply and high demand, is one of
the hottest commodities on the market. It's a huge money maker.
So Chesapeake is in the right business at the right time -- and it's into it
heavily. Natural gas accounts for almost 90 percent of all the business that
Chesapeake does.
This has already caught the attention of some prominent investment experts.
Chuck Clough has picked Chesapeake as one of his favorite companies in his
current favorite sector -- natural gas. And Clough isn't just anybody. Until
a year ago, he was chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. Shortly
after he left, he established a hedge fund that returned 17 percent, after
fees and costs, during an 11-month time period when the rest of the market
slid -- and the Nasdaq tumbled 44 percent.
Clough's young hedge fund now boasts $150 million in assets.
He's not too worried about falling natural gas prices. He's invested 32
percent of his portfolio in energy stocks and most of that in natural gas.
He's convinced that companies like Chesapeake will begin trading for much
more than two or three times their earnings -- and soon.
Stephen Smith, a Houston analyst for Dain Rauscher Wessels, considers
Chesapeake to be a top performer among the energy companies he covers. He is
convinced the stock is undervalued and that -- even after gaining 326 percent
last year -- Chesapeake will have another banner year in 2001.
"Natural gas prices don't have to stay at $7, $8, $9 or $10 for them to have
a good year," Smith said. "The prices could drop to $4 or $5, and that would
still be a wonderful doubling of what they used to be. If we can continue to
see $4 gas prices, then I think that energy stocks -- and particularly
Chesapeake -- will start to respond a bit more."
Thompson, who moves within local energy circles, is very optimistic.
"The natural gas prices we lived with for most of the '90s will never come
back," he said. "I can see a scenario with $4 and $5 gas prices for a long,
long time."

currently and with the additional volumes we would be within our 10% swing.
Either way wouldn't this be billed at gas daily as long as we are not
restricted?

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are
not reflected in the books. Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to
book since there is flexibility in the takes. Also, he said he has a strong
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it. Dick
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now. So Chris
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked. You can do what you want, but
I still think we should book it. The flexibility in takes is only 10% so
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't
book anything. Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to. In addition, per our
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year. This
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term. And finally, what if
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you
want.

doing because of the restriction, there will be a reduction @ the gate (meter
#52) of 370 dth.  Donna, you originally requested 2050 dth, it will now be
1680 dth.  I have been told that you should see the entire 1680 dth.

Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300
day from Phillips Production. That works out to about 429 day.

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be
4,000 for the month.

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it, CNG scheduler) has
agreed to help out any way she can. She knows escript pretty well. Chat
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure
out how to run all the reports we need back to January. Also, we will not
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to
Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool
gas.

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Hi Paul and Chris,
Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month. Did you guys do a deal for this gas too? He usually nominates
it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do
it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th). I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was
not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out
there
yet.
I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do. Just give me the word and I
will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is
the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it. Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on
or about October 31,2000 to Non-Contesting Parties related to the
Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to
those customers with interest from the date of payment to the
date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May 1, 1997
through February 29,2000 in excess of the amount that would have
been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the
Commission's findings in its March 17, 2000 order in Docket No.
RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues,
subject to the "refund floor". These interim partial refunds will
be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any
supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for
the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon
request.

If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim
partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final
Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital
Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds
related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non-
Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on
or before October 25, 2000, of its election not to participate in
the interim partial refunds.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool

Heidi
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. However, we
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples

Questions that I have:
1) I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.) This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production. If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.

2) If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3) Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?

4) If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
Phillips  Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you
can anwser this.

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now.

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the
application.

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons:
(1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names
into the group.
(2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the
messages after typing the
messages into the text box:
(1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
(2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second.
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10
second. Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I
will move it into production environment soon.

HEADER_CONTENT Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up
under 2 desk, Market East and East. All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco,
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes
away on 4/1, or East. So even on these pipes you will probably see the same
contract under both desk.

Hi team. Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade
behind NIMO. As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go
away but its not working. So, this is what I need to know;

Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr
2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

Clarissa, what did you find out about me receiving different volumes at Boston
than what I requested. We are penalized for over or under deliveries to that
pool. We are now in "critical day" status, which means that we are charged 5
times the daily index, which is GDA plus some other charges. It is very
important that I receive exactly the volume requested. Please talk with the
shipper and ask that they adjust the volume each day as requested.

I know that these are small voumes, but we have to play by the rules.

Day 1, requested 75, received 82
Day 2, requested 97, received 100
day 3, requested 87


For the weekend, I have changes only going to the Boston meter.

well, I'm in hawg heaven
and awed by yore charms.

such a purdy, young doe.

I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me.
If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities
are the same now. In Jan, the "true backhaul" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was
$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges. We actually did
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until
October, after the summer period?

list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

HEADER_KEYWORDS capacity brooklyn trader pipelines firm
HEADER_SUBJECT  
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Vince and Vasant:

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for
overhead expenses. A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 . The trader's spread is
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity.
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet). For South Texas and
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc). And, once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

Remember the demand charge that was entered in the sales side that you killed

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index
published : April 19, 2000

ANR Gets Green Light for Transco Interconnect

ANR Pipeline last week won a two-year battle at FERC to build a direct
interconnect to Transcontinental
Gas Pipe Line's mainline facilities at Evangeline Parish, LA --- near
the site of an active natural gas sales
market.

On rehearing, the Commission upheld a July 1998 order granting a
complaint in which ANR accused
Transco of discriminating against it by denying a request to construct
minor interconnection facilities that
would provide its shippers with direct access to gas sales markets on
Transco's system at Evangeline.

Specifically, the Coastal Corp. pipeline has fought to obtain a direct
connection to Station 50, which is one
of several compressor stations on Transco's mainline serving as pooling
points. There, producers and
marketers sell gas to LDCs and other buyers who hold firm capacity on
Transco for shipment to
downstream markets. The gas sale market at Station 50 is said to be a
"premium one."

In order to get their gas to Station 50 now, ANR shippers must deliver
gas via ANR's existing
interconnection on Transco's Central Louisiana Lateral at Eunice, LA,
and then purchase interruptible
transportation (IT) service on Transco for a distance of about 7.4
miles. So, in effect, ANR shippers
currently must pay "stacked rates" for service on ANR's existing
interconnect and for service on Transco's
IT feeder to reach Station 50.

But the Commission last week found that ANR's request for a direct
interconnection at Evangeline was
reasonable under three different analyses. "First, the evidence shows
that Transco has provided no
reasonable justification for denying ANR's request, given Transco's
history of granting such requests made
by similarly situated parties," the order said [CP98-74]. Six pipelines
other than ANR currently have direct
interconnections on Transco's mainline in the Gulf region that were
established prior to Transco's
restructuring under Order 636, and none of the shippers pay an IT rate
in order to get gas to Transco's
mainline markets, according to the order.

Secondly, evidence suggests the denial of an interconnection for ANR
has led to "specific competitive harm
to the operations of sales markets on Transco's mainline," the
Commission said. That's because buyers at
Station 50 have been barred access to the competitively priced gas
supplies that ANR's shippers seek to
offer, FERC noted. Lastly, it said the establishment of the Evangeline
interconnect for ANR was required
under the new five-step interconnection policy for gas pipelines, which
FERC unveiled last week.

In upholding the July 1998 decision, the Commission overturned an
administrative law judge's (ALJ) initial
findings that competition hadn't been adversely harmed at Station 50,
and that FERC's prior approval of the
IT feeder system provided "appropriate support" for Transco to deny ANR
the Evangeline interconnect.

"We are persuaded by the record in this case that ANR cannot offer a
pipeline transportation service
reasonably competitive with those provided by Transco and other
interstate pipelines, without the
Evangeline interconnect, a minor facility consisting of valve access to
Transco's mainline," the order
concluded.

The Commission also rejected Transco's claim that it partly denied
ANR's request for the Evangeline
interconnect because it would have led to a revenue loss on its IT
Feeder system. As the FERC staff noted,
"six other interstate pipelines currently use mainline interconnects
[on Transco].....but no evidence indicates
the extent of even arguably identifiable business loss from these
pipeline competitors," the order noted. If
anything, "Transco has accorded itself an anti-competitive
preference.....to assure that its own IT service is
used in lieu of the potential alternative proposed by ANR."

Subject: CKY 6-12 January 2000 - cut 29th 767 dth

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.  However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.  They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.   When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.  I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.  I
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.  I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.  I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.  She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.  She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).  I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.  However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.  I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short, we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).  Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago,
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented
capacity. Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement
shipper. Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not)
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible. For instance,
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on

That means that CES can still look at TCO scheduling activities. CES did not
realize they had this access until recently. Noel Bartlo is in Herndon, and
is teaching this group how to manage its assets. TCO told me that CES is
still looking at how we are scheduling our gas.

BOTTOM LINE.... We need everyone's help to get this paperwork signed and

Calp is not listed below, since it is a wholesale deal. If we can get Calp

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible. For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it. I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one). Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to

NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION:


In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk

rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.

If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk
last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara
Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity
to
you. However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an
Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG
capacity to you.  The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March,
2000. Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of
April.

Hi team. Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade

away but its not working. So, this is what I need to know;

Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr
2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

500,000 over May's MMIQ was already approved and in TCO's gas control records.
200,000 to 300,000 additional was approved on Thursday, May 25, with Steve
Stonestreet, Julie Watkins, and Brian Adams, verbally on the phone.

Enron should have a total of 800,000 on gas control's books over May's MMIQ.
Joann needs a total of 822,000 to overinject for the month. Per my
conversation with Mike Ng, he will ask for the incremental 22,000; for a
total of 822,000. Mike will let us know if the incremental 22,000 has been
approved.

Joann also needs the 59,520 for May 31st for a daily overinjection which has
already been approved by Don Belcher at TCO.

Julie/Steve, please pass this note to Mike.... I don't have his e-mail
address.

Thank you for your help.

Subject: Re: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John
Singer). Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

FYI
Based on a request by Dennis Bond, a new report has been added that allows
external customers to see the group, name, and description for all reports
that
they can run. The report is called RPT_GROUPS_EX (group Reports), and can be
run by internal users as well. Only reports that are available to all
external
customers are included, so company specific reports will not be displayed.
Currently the report is 10 pages, and does not include a data file
(description
can be up to 200 characters, and doesn't fit well into a spreadsheet). Dennis
wanted to be able to give new customers something to help them get started
with
the various billing report options. Since showing all reports didn't require
that many pages, thought it might be helpful to include everything. Good
idea!

HEADER_SUBJECT Memo from Shelley Corman: FERC Staff Conference Today
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Today, FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are
necessary to promote further market liquidity. The conference was fairly
well attended by FERC staff, including Dan Larcamp and Shelton Cannon.

Some common themes:
Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not
necessary.
Commodity markets are very liquid.
FERC policies, GISB and Order 637 have helped to make capacity markets more
liquid.
Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in
Order No. 637 compliance filings.
Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity (with pipelines making the
distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea,
standardization of product offerings is not).
There is very little consensus on further areas for change. In nearly every
case, a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another.
In any event, most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes.

Areas without consensus:
Shipper-must-have-title rule. LDCs argue it should be removed; while Process
Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release
market.
Production area rate design. LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy
service downstrream of a market pool. Reliant and Koch also argued that
pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates.
The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area.
SFV. East Coast LDCs, Michcon, and APGA argued for moving off of SFV. The
producers and industrials oppose. Illinois Power/Dynegy also argued for
moving off SFV.


LDC Positions
The LDCs main themes were removing the shipper-must-have-title and enabling
LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers. However, they also argued
that pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric
generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically
enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs .  This is the point that AGA
raised in the blanket intervention to all Order 637 compliance filings.
Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are
entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a
best efforts basis, perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not
have been fully subscribed. LDCs, generally stating that 637 compliance
filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation, continued to stress
the need for segmentation, including "geographical segmentation of ROFR
capacity."

Some Specific Proposals
NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form 2 filings.
A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information,
though specific needs were not well defined.
Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties
(especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for
arbitrage).
Alliance of Energy Suppliers (marketing arm of EEI) called for a dialogue
between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly
variability. They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to
match the power grid (Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to
standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well).
The GISB End-User group (represented by Salt River Project) complained about
the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas
transactions to be "tagged" like electric transactions.

E-Commerce and Capacity Trading
Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity
trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy
transactions, remove posting periods and long contract execution periods. He
made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary.
Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme, admonishing the
FERC not to micro-manage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist
on a single platform. He said that liquidity cannot be legislated. From his
perspective, natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets
in the world. FERC should worry about transferring the "good stuff" from
natural gas to electric markets, not the reverse.

To ensure everyone is on the same page.

500,000 over May's MMIQ was already approved and in TCO's gas control records.
200,000 to 300,000 additional was approved on Thursday, May 25, with Steve
Stonestreet, Julie Watkins, and Brian Adams, verbally on the phone.

Enron should have a total of 800,000 on gas control's books over May's MMIQ.
Joann needs a total of 822,000 to overinject for the month. Per my
conversation with Mike Ng, he will ask for the incremental 22,000; for a
total of 822,000. Mike will let us know if the incremental 22,000 has been
approved.

Joann also needs the 59,520 for May 31st for a daily overinjection which has
already been approved by Don Belcher at TCO.

Julie/Steve, please pass this note to Mike.... I don't have his e-mail
address.

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible. For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it. I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one). Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up. I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please

Subject: Tribute to the United States
TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES
This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth
sharing. America: The Good Neighbor.
Widespread but only partial news coverage was
given recently to a remarkable editorial
broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a
Canadian television commentator. What follows is
the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed
in the Congressional Record:
"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for
the Americans as the most generous and possibly
the least appreciated people on all the earth.
Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain
and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by
the Americans who poured in billions of dollars
and forgave other billions in debts. None of
these countries is today paying even the interest
on its remaining debts to the United States.
When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956,
it was the Americans who propped it up, and their
reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.
When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the
United States that hurries in to help. This
spring, 59 American communities were flattened by
tornadoes. Nobody helped.
The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped
billions of dollars into discouraged countries.
Now newspapers in those countries are writing
about the decadent, war-mongering Americans.
I'd like to see just one of those countries that
is gloating over the erosion of the United States
dollar build its own airplane. Does any other
country in the world have a plane to equal the
Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the
Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why
do all the International lines except Russia fly
American Planes?
Why does no other land on earth even consider
putting a man or woman on the moon? You talk
about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
You talk about German technocracy, and you get
automobiles.
You talk about American technocracy, and you find
men on the moon - not once, but several times -
and safely home again.
You talk about scandals, and the Americans put
theirs right in the store window for everybody to
look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
and hounded. They are here on our streets, and
most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian
laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa
at home to spend here.
When the railways of France, Germany and India
were breaking down through age, it was the
Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania
Railroad and the New York Central went broke,
nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are
still broke.
I can name you 5000 times when the Americans
raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can
you name me even one time when someone else raced
to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there
was outside help even during the San Francisco
earthquake.
Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one
Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
kicked around. They will come out of this thing
with their flag high. And when they do, they are
entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that
are gloating over their present troubles. I hope
Canada is not one of those."
Stand proud, America!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is one of the best editorials that I have
ever read regarding the United States. It is nice
that one man realizes it. I only wish that the
rest of the world would realize it. We are always
blamed for everything, and never even get a thank
you for the things we do.
I would hope that each of you would send this to
as many people as you can and emphasize that they
should send it to as many of their friends until
this letter is sent to every person on the web. I
am just a single American that has read this, I
SURE HOPE THAT A LOT MORE READ IT SOON.

November production that don't mirror that. Formosa deal #463959 starts on

If I'm reading this correctly, this is for the CES sale to Metro Media. I

The price is IF CGAS + $.0175 + Variable Cost + $.02 demand (if we use ENA
transport). Charlie and I can chat about the transport after bid week.

Molly, CES will not include these volumes on the FOM sheet. I added a
worksheet in the CES transport file for these volumes.

Please forward this on to anyone else that needs to see it and as always,
don't hesitate to call if you have questions.

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are
not reflected in the books. Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to
book since there is flexibility in the takes. Also, he said he has a strong
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it. Dick
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now. So Chris
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.
EMAIL_END

HEADER_CONTENT cc: Steve Jackson/HOU/ECT@ECT

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked. You can do what you want, but
I still think we should book it. The flexibility in takes is only 10% so
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't
book anything. Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to. In addition, per our
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year. This
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term. And finally, what if
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you
want.

after announcing record earnings.

Examples:
CHK earnings report on 2/20 stock price=$10.80, by 2/24 stock price = $9.10.
GW earnings report on 2/12 price = $6.70, by 3/1 price $5.05.

DNR earnings 2/23 price + $11.00 by 3/1 $9.70
CRK earnings 2/14 price = $13.80 by 2/20 $10.20

In order to prepare for EDI, I have reviewed the February invoice from

Sylvia, please modify similar to National fuels by creating a new service
type - "Park and Loan - Non Pathed" to be effective 6-1-00. Are there any
others? Please notify the above when done.

Chris, will you set up a new deal ticket on this new service in Sitara when
available and notify Angie? Terminate the old deal ticket effective 5-31-00

Angie, it appears you are already pathing this contract correctly, it will
be necessary to select the correct service from the service list for June 1st
nominations. There are some other contracts that I believe we need to change
the pathing methodology on in the near future.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost

Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. However, we
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples

Questions that I have:
1) I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.) This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production. If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.

2) If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3) Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?

4) If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples

Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to

of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool

Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool

HEADER_CONTENT 1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's

If yes, how many meters?

If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's

is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid ed to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib le on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.

David
Is there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market
area pipes to the Market East p&l? If the only reason is that you're not
sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion. It seems to me that there are
only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee,
Texas Eastern and Transco. For now, why don't we leave all the demand
charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the
East p&l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East
book: Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG,
Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel.

Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to
make sense to me. Please advise.

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999. (Applause
here!) Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled via a manual line item.

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type. For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity. Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting. Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close. The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31. This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara. Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month. For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator. They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
forward.

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting... Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1. We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for
production months older than 12/1999. This allows us to focus our efforts on
current month. Per Bryce, applaud here!

2. Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3. Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4. Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator. Changes should be made
effective 12/1999 production forward.

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions. If
necessary, please forward to your teams.

Chris,

1- According to EES, the price on deal #116090 should be CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I
+0.014. However, Sitara shows the price index is CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I +0.032.
Could you please verify which rate should I be using in billing EES?

2- On deal #156406, I was told by Judy Barn that this is an internal
(financial) deal, therefore, it did not get downloaded into Settlement.
However, per Patricia Downey at EES, this is a financial deal that was turned
physical. Would you please also confirm this wherether we should bill EES
for this deal or not?

Thank you in advance for your help.

HEADER_CONTENT Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as
possible. This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible. I'm not sure how you or
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating
transport p&l. In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas. These could
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates. The
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES
business in our portfolio, the times have changed. Currently we are using
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and
how we are marking the curves. For example, today's Gas Daily postings
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY  GAS DAILY SPREAD  SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985  $1.565   $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39  $ .585   $.16
CNG South $3.305  $ .670   $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong. There are
two solutions that I see. One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace. That's up to you.
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it),
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago,
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented
capacity. Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement
shipper. Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not)
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible. For instance,
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on
Iroquois' system? Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments
on this issue. I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

Victor and Robert,
Please let us know if you can be of any help on this one. The only deal with
volumes that I see for Beldan and Blake is deal 226556 and it appears to have
been netted with a CES deal 235398, in which case there would be nothing in
navigator. The deal that I believe Wade is referring to is 345224, but it is
showing a zero volume in unify.

Terry, I see several deals out there for Beldan and Blake all at NYSEG but
with different prices. The only one with volume is 226556 for a total volume
of 4991. Is possible that all the volume may have been put on the one deal
and should have been spread amongst the several deals?

Thanks!

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn.
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend.
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.  Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.  I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 markets until Monday, 12/27. We will need a
range from 2800 dth to 3600 dth per day.  This large swing is normal for
these
types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999. (Applause
here!) Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled via a manual line item.

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type. For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity. Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting. Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close. The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31. This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara. Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month. For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator. They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
forward.

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting... Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

I also created deal 643761 (sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS). I believe

HEADER_SUBJECT Transco capacity issue
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we
are buying. Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary. I would
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the
month. Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt
and delivery point on the contract. But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it
and I am unable to verify the information myself. It could have a big impact
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process? Let
me know if you need specific capacity examples.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Colleen/Chris: I'm working from memory here, but I'm pretty sure that the
new Order 637 reporting requirements require the Index of Customers to list
the primary receipt and delivery points. However, in checking the FERC web
site, the pipelines are only required to update the Index of Customers
quarterly. Therefore, the indices filed under the new reporting requirements
won't be out until early October. I will look into this more closely when I
get back.

Chris -- Is your Penn Fuel release on Transco or Tennessee? I couldn't find
"Penn Fuel" on either the Transco or Tennessee Index of Customers as of
7/1/00. Do they have another "legal" name?

P.S. Here in western North Carolina, the high today was about 70 degrees.
It's sure going to be rough coming back to 100. But I understand y'all will
have a cool spell tomorrow. It's supposed to be way down to 92!! We'll be
warming up to about 72.

HEADER_CONTENT After reviewing the Action Items from 07/17/2000 and more thoroughly analyzing the =01&validation task=018 assigned to John Singer and myself, w e have changed our approach. Instead, I recruited Jeanne Wukasch to help pull together a more effective strategy and assist with the cleanup process. We are calling on Jim Javin and John Singer to rule only on exceptions or conflicts in data. Also, we are meeting with Logistics and IT to establish a workable solution to clear-up paths with more than one deal. Our review of the Appalachian data is based primarily on wellhead activity from the following sources:

Path Manager Supply =01) This gives us the ability to sort data easily, pro vide views of deals and path relationships. This screen allows us to identify duplicate deals under the same meter and incorrect trading desk assignments . We can also trace purchase information to the transport detail.
Unify Transaction List =01) This is an extract of Apr-00 production data ou t of Unify Purchase and Transport files. This list permits us to compare purcha se price deducts vs. transport payments by meter. (Manual payments and the inconsistencies in the Unify set-up of pipe structures will require additional effort in this area.) The end result of our efforts will provid e:

a deal reference for meters listed more than once
consolidation of wellhead deals by pipe
correct Market East regional designation
purchase deducts not corresponding to pipeline payments
meters without purchase payments
incorrect price adjustments for transport cost

A status update has been scheduled for August 15 at 1 PM in room EB 3014.  Our goal is to have completed Gatherco and CNR wellheads. To date our progress has revealed:

Meters with multiple deals   73
Meters not on Market East deals  167
Different counter-parties with the same meter  13
Deducts missing from the purchase price  47
Purchase prices with incorrect deducts  85

HEADER_CONTENT Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we

HEADER_CONTENT Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2: The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue. Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3. Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.  Here is what is happening: Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.  We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers. So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items. That's problem one. Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations. We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want). For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.  I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4. Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you. Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges. This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. Let us know what
you would prefer. Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29. Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7. I apologize for the delay.

5. Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday. Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
balances.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool

Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. However, we
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples

Questions that I have:
1) I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.) This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production. If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.

2) If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3) Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?

4) If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions

is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Joann, if this gas will not flow on secondary transport from the pool for the

Computer Gender

An English teacher was explaining to the students
the
concept of gender
association in the English language; noting how
hurricanes at one time were
given only female names, and how ships and planes
were
usually referred to
as "she." One of the students raised her hand and
asked,
"What gender is a
computer?"

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class
into two
groups:? males
in one, females in the other, and asked them to
decide if
a computer should
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked
to give
four reasons for
their recommendations.

??? The group of women concluded that computers
should be
referred to as
masculine because:

1. In order to get their attention, you have to
turn them
on.

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.

3. They are supposed to help you solve your
problems, but
half the time,
they ARE the problem.

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that,
if you
had waited a
little longer, you could have had a better model.

??? The men, on the other hand, decided that
computers
should definitely be
referred to as feminine because:

1. No one but their creator understands their
internal
logic.

2. The native language they use to communicate
with other
computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else.

3.? Even your smallest mistakes are stored in
long-term
memory for later
retrieval.

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you
find
yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.

Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240)
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had to tranfer the
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at
Friday's P&L. This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday resulting in taking the
Sunday's gain away from your book.

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type. Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

3) Please confirm that your model type is always "P" pathed from noms all
the
way down to invoices.

Our model type is always "P" for pathed.

do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a

recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was
cleared with Connie Sutton. So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.

SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1. Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after
paying the transport cost. However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the
prices listed below. For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone
SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou. The total transport cost is $.02
(including demand - this changes each month). We don't arb the supply with
Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this
is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid
price and the transport expense?

If I buy onshore, take it through mainline, take it through leach, and take

point. If I drop it off in TCO pool, then I pay the GRI there?? I can't

Well, the time has finally arrived............after purchasing some bean bag
and inflatable 'Southpark' chairs, I'm officially ready for a party. Won't
you please come over and share in a few cocktails.  This Saturday, March 31
at 7:30, 1314 Utah St. (corner of Truro and Utah, near Memorial Park)  I
will have beverages and snacks, but as in the past, no jello shots or Busch
beer. (sorry Matt and Mike)

Most of you aren't aware of where I live, but parking could be a problem.
(sorry, no valet)  In the 'hood', people tend to park wherever they can,
this being along all the streets surrounding the house as well as the
volleyball courts at Bubbas. Park wherever you can.

Please see the attached map or go to Yahoo Maps for assistance. It works
well if you use 1380 Utah St. (Don't ask why)  Please pass this on to
others that I may have overlooked. Call if you have any questions.

you recall, one contract is to COH for 20,000/d through 10/31/00 (#65402);
the other is to BG&E for 19,000/d through 4/01(#65403). This is the
information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me--you need to confirm that
this information is accurate.

I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest

FYI -- Press Release received this morning:

Cove Point LNG to Begin Open Season Process For Capacity at its LNG Receiving
Terminal
?
02/16/2000
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2000, PR Newswire)

HERNDON, Va, Feb. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a
subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, announced today that it will conduct an
open season from February 16 to March 16, 2000, for a firm LNG tanker
discharging service at its Cove Point LNG terminal. The new service will
include the unloading of LNG from tankers, LNG storage, vaporization, and
delivery of natural gas to points along Cove Point's existing pipeline.

Cove Point LNG is offering 750,000 dekatherms per day of deliverability and
4.25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of vapor equivalent storage capacity initially.
The service includes a proposed expansion of the available storage capacity
to 6.75 Bcf approximately one year after the start-up of the LNG receiving
operations. Pending approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
Cove Point LNG plans to begin the LNG tanker discharging service by late
2001.

Located in Lusby, Md., the Cove Point LNG terminal includes liquefied natural
gas storage and terminal operations, and an 87-mile natural gas pipeline that
connects with gas pipelines in Northern Virginia. The terminal has installed
send-out capacity of 1 Bcf of gas per day. With the proposed storage
expansion, total LNG storage at Cove Point will be 7.5 Bcf of vapor
equivalent natural gas. The Cove Point LNG terminal currently provides "peak
shaving" services to customers in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions.

Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading
energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its
operating companies engage in virtually all phases of the natural gas
business, including exploration and production, transmission, storage and
distribution, as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum
product sales, and electric power generation. Information about Columbia
Energy Group (NYSE: CG) is available on the Internet at
www.columbiaenergygroup.com.

This press release contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning
of the Federal securities laws, including statements concerning, on a
consolidated, segment or subsidiary basis, Columbia's plans, objectives and
expected performance. There can be no assurance that actual results will not
differ materially due to various factors, many of which are beyond the
control of Columbia, including, but not limited to, the regulatory approval
process, competition, weather, supply and demand for natural gas, and changes
in general economic conditions.

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type. Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in

manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

HEADER_CONTENT I have been speaking with Sylvia Campos on this. Originally they wanted to
do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a
different service type (so as not to change historically). To my
recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was
cleared with Connie Sutton. So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.

What's the final answer.... do you need the enduser gas or do you want me
to cut the enduser gas?

If you really need the enduser gas... the only other option is for me...
is to beg TCO to let me inject some pool gas into storage for that gas day
to avoid the $10 withdrawal penalty... but we would still incur the overrun
charge plus the additional overrun charge to get the gas into storage. Need
a decision by 1 pm CST time on Monday, January 31st. Thank you!!!!

Please pass this note to Melissa... still don't have her e-mail address.

Can't wait for it to warm up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: TCO STOW Overage - 1/24

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted
amount (+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was
over-withdrawn. Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage
over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the
weekend. If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the
storage over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please
tell me what you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is
still feeling generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try
to cause unnecessary pain.

HEADER_CONTENT Sent a retro request to TCO last week with two options:

1) Inject into storage from CES IPP pool, which was long that day.
2) In ground storage transfer from Dayton's FSS storage to CES's FSS storage.
Dayton has given Enron the approval to move this storage.

I told TCO the second option would be the most viable option, and it should
not comprise TCO's position with its other shippers.

As of right now, TCO has put all retro requests on hold. The bills will
probably go out with these penalties on it. However, TCO will revisit the
penalty issue, once the dust has settled. We are not the only shipper that
incurred penalties, and TCO wants to treat everyone fairly. I did tell TCO to
remember that Enron is not an affiliate, and TCO needs to treat Enron as TCO
would its other shippers.

HEADER_KEYWORDS pse primary penn transco capacity
HEADER_SUBJECT Transco capacity issue
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we
are buying. Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary. I would
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the
month. Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt
and delivery point on the contract. But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it
and I am unable to verify the information myself. It could have a big impact
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process? Let
me know if you need specific capacity examples.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The name is PPL ENPLUS which I believe is short for PPL Energy Plus. I
purchased 4,752 dt on TRANSCO. The primary receipt point is CNG-Leidy and
the primary delivery point is Mainline BG&E. The offer number is 21575-001.

I feel comfortable that the points listed above are the primary receipt and
delivery points because of our relationship with Penn Fuel. Following is the
example Judy and I discussed with Transco.


EXAMPLE
Assume PSE&G has 100,000 dt of telescoped capacity with a primary delivery
point of PSE&G, downstream of Linden. ENA purchases 20,000 dt of telescoped
capacity from PSE&G under the following scenarios;

1.PSE&G released the capacity with PSE&G as the delivery point.
ENA has primary rights of 20,000 to PSE&G and secondary rights of 20,000 to
New York (no change, same as before).

ENA could flow 20,000 from the Gulf to BG&E (upstream of the Linden and the
Leidy Line) on a primary basis. AND 20,000 from Nat Fuel-Leidy to PSE&G
which is secondary on the Leidy Line, and Primary on the mainline to PSE&G.
AND 20,000 from Tenn-Rivervale to BUG on a secondary basis. These paths are
not overlapping and ENA could effectivly schedule

Subject: Re: Transco capacity issue

Colleen/Chris: I'm working from memory here, but I'm pretty sure that the
new Order 637 reporting requirements require the Index of Customers to list
the primary receipt and delivery points. However, in checking the FERC web
site, the pipelines are only required to update the Index of Customers
quarterly. Therefore, the indices filed under the new reporting requirements
won't be out until early October. I will look into this more closely when I
get back.

Chris -- Is your Penn Fuel release on Transco or Tennessee? I couldn't find
"Penn Fuel" on either the Transco or Tennessee Index of Customers as of
7/1/00. Do they have another "legal" name?

P.S. Here in western North Carolina, the high today was about 70 degrees.
It's sure going to be rough coming back to 100. But I understand y'all will

This ticket has been used for the total 10,000. This may be incorrect. (April

On Thursday, December 7,2000, IOGA WV and Dominion Transmission (formerly CNG
Transmission) announced that they have reached a five year agreement on
gathering rates. Although this agreement is subject to FERC's approval,
there should be no problem having FERC OK.

This agreement becomes effective January 1, 2001. Under the agreement,
Dominion WILL NOT invoice either the producer or his agent (i.e. ENA) for
gathering or processing. Instead, Dominion will increase the gas retention
percentages to cover the costs of both gathering and processing. They are:

1/1/2001 - 6/30/2003
7/1/2003 - 12/31-2005

Transmission Dry
0                             0
Transmission Wet
3.91%                         3.51%
Gathering Dry
9.34%                          9.34%
Gathering Wet
13.25%                        12.85%

As of yesterday, Dominion was not sure exactly how they will communicate the
production information to the producer and/or his agent. My guess is that
they will send a monthly statement which willl have two volumes for each
meter. The first volume will be the wellhead volume delivered to the meter
(a gross volume) . This volume will be adjusted by the retention percentage
which will equate to the sales volume (gross volume less gathering and/or
processing). The sales volume will be the volume we will pay the producer
for since it will be net of gathering and/or processing. There will be no
additional charges. ENA will not be required send monies to Dominion.

As additional information becomes available, I will forward.

Unless I'm missing something, it does not appear that there is a way for us
to run a CPR report that shows all business done on a particular pipe

being done on Transco, I must run the report for both the Northeast desk and
the Market East desk. This next weekend, the east is to be split into 12
different desks, which will only complicate the issue even more.

Russ Severson has the position screen set so that all business will roll into
one position manager. Is there any way that we get something similar from
the reporting environment. I'm thinking that the easiest way might be to
have the ability to select just a pipe without being forced to select a desk

HEADER_CONTENT Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

HEADER_CONTENT Scott--The volumes delivered into Central Hudson off Iroquois for Arma
Textiles
was included in Exhibit 1 of the 12/99 Energy Purchase Agreement such that it
would appear that Enron would be supplying this gas to CES.  However, the gas
to supply Arma was already purchased from Duke Energy, and as far as I can
tell, Enron has had nothing to do with delivering this gas, and Duke Energy
has
billed us directly for the gas that they supply each month.

I discussed this with Chris Germany, and we agreed that CES would just deal
directly with Duke Energy on this and leave Enron out of it.  Accordingly,
if
you look at the May'00 first-of-the-month request that I sent to Enron on
April
24, the table does show 135 dth/day into Central Hudson off Iroquois.
However,
the table notes that this gas is being supplied by Duke Energy and therefore
no
volumes are being requested from Enron.

Please let me know if this needs further action or clarification.

If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool).
If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me. Metered production
or pool gas on CNG?

David, Sea Robin Pool is a zone on the Sea Robin Pipeline (SEAR). The Sea
Robin Pool zone includes many different meters some of which do have a prefix
of ISRP. However, there are also other meters in that zone that have the
following prefixes: LSRP, FSRP and PSRP. I mapped the entire zone to the new
curves you sent us. Given your message it seems like things might not be
peachy after all if you only wanted the ISRP meters mapped that way. Please
call me as soon as you get a chance.

HEADER_CONTENT I think the best thing to do would be to create a separate zone for all of

and incur transport. Therefore having two zone would more accurately
represent what is actually happening.

Subject: Re: Sea Robin Well Head Curve

Well, whenever we map specific meters on a zone to curves that are different
than what the entire zone is mapped to, we create an alternative facility
mapping for each specific meter that you want mapped differently. Currently,
there are 137 active meters on the Sea Robin Pool zone with a prefix of
ISRP. That would mean I would have to create 137 alternative facility
mappings. Another alternative would be to have all of those meters moved to
their own zone and then just create one mapping for that whole zone.
However, this will also take a great deal of time, since Global Facilities
would have to change the zone on every single facility record. Plus, we
would have to see what type of activity is on all of these meters and we
would have to update the zone on all of these deals after Global Facilities
made it's change. So, let me know what your thoughts are. What are you
doing in London???

Subject: GELP questions



I have a couple of questions about the GELP contract. First, in the
agreement's
Attachment A, there are several fuel contracts agreements listed that GELP has
(or had) in place with various counterparties. I'm wondering what the status
of
these agreements is--have they expired, are they still in place, etc. These
agreements are:
Purchase Agreements:
Union Pacific Fuels--I understand that this is the Duke contract that
currently supplies GELP--Can we get a copy of this agreement?
Tejas Power Corporation--Expired ???
Columbia Energy Services Corporation dated 1/15/96 - Expired ???
Storage Agreements
Columbia Gas Transmission SIT #41825 - Status ??
Transportation Agreements
CGT-IT agreement #41828 - I'm assuming this is the agreement used to get
gas to GELP--is Duke or CES agent on this?
Commonwealth Gas Services - same question as CGT IT agreement
Note: According to the billing calculations, it appears that the
Duke
supply arrangement must have some
FT transport--whose name is that in?
Other Contracts
Transco - to be acquired - Is there an IT agreement on Transco that is
used? If so, we need contract # and is someone agent on the transport?

Also, in the GELP agreement you indicated that you get real time meter
information from a Bristol RTU. How will ENA get this meter information?

Also, just in general--could you explain your perspective on the value
proposition in this agreement? I understand that there is a $5000 fee you
receive each month that accompanies alot of reporting responsibilities. Since
the data you provided for last year showed very little gas deliveries in the
"winter period" (where you would receive $.05/MMBtu additional compensation),
there doesn't seem to be much up side value there.  Are there other values
you
see to this deal that we may be missing?

Thanks for your assistance.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT cc:

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2: The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue. Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3. Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.  Here is what is happening: Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.  We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers. So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items. That's problem one. Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations. We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want). For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.  I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4. Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you. Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges. This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. Let us know what
you would prefer. Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29. Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7. I apologize for the delay.

5. Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday. Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
balances.

HEADER_CONTENT Phil,

Bruce asked me to e-mail our information to you. The following spreadsheet
outlines the amounts we owe you for each production month. This shows you
the exact charges we are to pay along with how much credit we are due in
each production month. Each MARQ and FTNN charge on CNG Demand is credited
on our monthly CNG Demand billing. This is showing us that you should have
been billed this amount by CNG Transmission and then in turn you should
bill us these amounts.

(Embedded image moved to file: pic07770.pcx)

If you need any backup in regards to these demand charges, please notify me
by e-mail or you may call me at (315) 460-4122. These amounts are showing
outstanding in our accounting statements, so therefore, I will be happy to
assist you in any way I can to get these amounts paid. When billing,
please fax me a copy of your complete bill and also mail an original in the
mail. According to our contracts, we need an original invoice complete
with wire instructions in order to make payment to your company.

Sincerely,

Becky E. Morrow
Fuel Clerk of Gas Supply

Chris,

Have you had a chance to look at this yet? It sound like NIMO is still
willing to pay the fair amount, we just need to make sure that we actually
bill them. Let me know how I can help.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate. Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup). Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

HEADER_CONTENT I did take a look at the $139,000 home. This house has been on the market
for awhile. The backyard sits next to some big building - that's a bad
thing. I have not had a chance to look at the other house - the sq
footage
seems really small though. Based on what I've seen over the last 8
months,
it would take something around $190's - $205's to make me happy and I'm
not
willing to spend that much right now.
Another thing that bothers me is the economy. All I hear about are
layoffs. The only industry still booming is the energy industry and we
keep streamlining. That's what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a
house.
Thanks for the info though.

On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom): "Do not turn upside down." (well...duh, a bit late, huh)!

On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding:"Product will be hot after heating." (...and you thought????...)

On packaging for a Rowenta iron: "Do not iron clothes on body." (but wouldn't this save me more time)?

On Boot's Children Cough Medicine:"Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication." (We could do a lot to reduce the rate of
construction accidents if we could just get those 5-year-olds with head-colds off those forklifts.)

On Nytol Sleep Aid: "Warning: May cause drowsiness." (and...I'm taking this because???....)

On most brands of Christmas lights: "For indoor or outdoor use only." (as opposed to...what)?

On a Japanese food processor: "Not to be used for the other use." (now, somebody out there, help me on this. I'm a bit curious.)

On Sunsbury's peanuts: "Warning: contains nuts." (talk about a news flash)

On an American Airlines packet of nuts: "Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts." (Step 3: maybe, uh...fly Delta?)

On a child's superman costume: "Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly." (I don't blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.)

HEADER_KEYWORDS eastern actual receipts texas warning
HEADER_SUBJECT TE Critical System Warning
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001. Based on
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until
further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season. At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full. As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area. No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order ("OFO") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm. In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

This Confirm was sent to the counterparty but it is not showing that we received an executed copy back


EE9092.1 (Sitara# 10258, no confirms on file, in TAGG & in Sitara & DCAF, states that this is a rebooking of E23290.1)
EE9092.3 (TAGG states that this is a rebooking of E23290.4, as part of E23290.1; no confirms on file)


E23290.1 (states "Retrofit - Oracle #52730.IB, 15419.02") 1/8/98

This LOOKS (at least as far as I can tell) like the volumes are a result of the Fuel Load need to support X HP hours for the compressor, this is echoed by a memo related to E23290 (looks like someone did an inquiry into this in 10/1995. I did a very quick scan of these "agreements" & it appears as all this looks to be gas for the "Hubbard Station" compressor fuel requirements (there is an Exhibit C that calcs out HP-hours into fuel requirements). Other than the SWAP confirms - - - - and this "agreement" I could not find anything else other than deal tkts.

The "Agreement" progression (for the Compression Services Agreement) goes like this:
3/1/95 Compression Services Agreement (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - Amended & Restated 11-1-97 (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - terminated & replaced by 6-29-00 Compression Services Agreement (Fuel Calc in Exhibit B).
The Fuel needs are found in the exhibits.

So, id according to the notes in TAGG & if all of these roll back to E23290 - - - - - here is your paperwork

Louis gave me some Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG) deals to research and he suggested that I talk to you if I have any questions.

According to Louis, when NNG did a deal with ENA, the deal would be booked under the counter party name RISKMANTRA. It appears that deal number NK7775.1 is a swap between NNG and ENA. I spoke to Morgan Gottsponer at NNG last week and he said he was hedging some of the NNG storage positions. I've pulled the confirmation for this deal out of the zip file attachment so you can see it. Unless you object, I'm going to ask risk management to change the counter party to RISKMANTRA in tagg.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions. I have some other items that deal with NNG and Enron Compression Services that I may ask you questions about but I'm still doing my research.

HEADER_CONTENT Hey team. I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it. Brenda Fletcher was asking me

Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.









When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this). Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space. I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel. Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).


Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in. Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3). As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price. I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.

Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal. That's around $1,340,000. I'm sure AEC is not expecting that. Does anyone here talk to AEC?

i added the producer selected reallocation date to the spreadsheet you provided and renamed it dtidec01split1.  As we discussed there were a number of meters that were not listed in your spreadsheet. I also found one counterparty that had a different producer date than pipeline date.  That counterparty was Elvis Energy.  The list of meters not in your file are listed below.

One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers. We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.

HEADER_CONTENT After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team.

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions.

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.

Retail

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT NGI's Daily Gas Price Index
published : October 5, 2001



Maritimes Moves Toward Expansion; U.S. Shippers Request 1.3 Bcf/d


Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline (Maritimes) said it received nominations for 1.7 Bcf/d of new transportation capacity on the Canadian portion of its pipeline system and 1.3 Bcf/d on the U.S. portion in an open season for its proposed $380 million Phase IV expansion project. Local distribution companies, gas-fired electric generators and third-party marketers were among those submitting substantial requests for transportation services, indicating a sizable market for natural gas reserves from eastern Canada, Maritimes said.

That sizable market has prompted rival El Paso Corp. to plan an entirely new offshore subsea pipeline that would bypass Maritimes and run from Sable Island to New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (see Daily GPI, Oct. 3). El Paso said earlier this week the $1.6 billion Blue Atlantic Transmission System would be 750 miles long and carry up to 1 Bcf/d of gas to U.S. markets starting in the first quarter of 2005.

With pipeline already in place and an open season completed, Maritimes has a firm lead in this race to add capacity. Its Phase IV project would begin service about the same time. Canadian markets have requested deliveries along the mainline and laterals to Point Tupper, Halifax and Saint John. The U.S. nominations requested deliveries of substantial volumes into Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.'s proposed HubLine interconnection in Beverly, MA. The majority of the nominations seek services beginning in the 2004 to 2006 time frame.

"The Maritimes system was designed and constructed to accommodate the anticipated development of new natural gas fields," said Philip Knoll, president of Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline LP. "Given our ability to quickly and cost-effectively expand the system primarily through compression, we can be ready to deliver new supplies as early as 2004." The company also expects to add some looping line in Canada for the project.

Earlier this year, Maritimes and PanCanadian Petroleum signed agreements to transport up to 400 MMcf/d of gas from PanCanadian's Deep Panuke project, offshore Nova Scotia. To transport the PanCanadian volumes, Maritimes will invest C$590 million to expand its capacity to 1 Bcf/d, nearly doubling the existing system capacity.

Maritimes will now work with the responding parties to determine the need for additional pipeline and compression facilities for the expansion. It expects to file applications with government agencies in both the United States and Canada later this year.

HEADER_CONTENT NK7775.1
This Confirm was sent to the counterparty but it is not showing that we received an executed copy back


EE9092.1 (Sitara# 10258, no confirms on file, in TAGG & in Sitara & DCAF, states that this is a rebooking of E23290.1)
EE9092.3 (TAGG states that this is a rebooking of E23290.4, as part of E23290.1; no confirms on file)


E23290.1 (states "Retrofit - Oracle #52730.IB, 15419.02") 1/8/98

This LOOKS (at least as far as I can tell) like the volumes are a result of the Fuel Load need to support X HP hours for the compressor, this is echoed by a memo related to E23290 (looks like someone did an inquiry into this in 10/1995. I did a very quick scan of these "agreements" & it appears as all this looks to be gas for the "Hubbard Station" compressor fuel requirements (there is an Exhibit C that calcs out HP-hours into fuel requirements). Other than the SWAP confirms - - - - and this "agreement" I could not find anything else other than deal tkts.

The "Agreement" progression (for the Compression Services Agreement) goes like this:
3/1/95 Compression Services Agreement (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - Amended & Restated 11-1-97 (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - terminated & replaced by 6-29-00 Compression Services Agreement (Fuel Calc in Exhibit B).
The Fuel needs are found in the exhibits.

So, id according to the notes in TAGG & if all of these roll back to E23290 - - - - - here is your paperwork

There is river frontage with canal frontage down the south side of lot. I

is the insurance and taxes all together, please itemize! Time to head out

HEADER_CONTENT Hey team. I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it. Brenda Fletcher was asking me

Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.









When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this). Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space. I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel. Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).


Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in. Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3). As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price. I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.

Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal. That's around $1,340,000. I'm sure AEC is not expecting that. Does anyone here talk to AEC?

Actually it is not a new truck. Had 33,000 miles, Ram 2500 3/4 ton, 4 x 4,
360 Magnum Motor. Infinity stereo, bucket seats, nerf bars, tool box, bed
liner, camper tow package, 5 speed manual. Oh, it is dueled out through one
catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound. Makes me want to
race!!! I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well. Now,
Debbie wants it. I gave $16,900 + tax. It is very clean and is Sandalwood,
Driftwood or something of that nature in color. Almost silver. I have to
pick up old gray over at Jerry's. Debbie said, it is going to be hard on me
to sale my old dodge truck. I said Yep, had that truck longer than I have
had most of my women. I really need to engage brain before articulating! I
am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before
rain. One thing is for sure, the economy is not faltering on my account.
Dow Stock is back up over $33. Hooray, hoorah!
Needs to go to $41 and then I will be happy. I spoke with Gerald and he
said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad's place. We need to
change the lock and place posted signs at the gate. I may want to put some
steers or heifers up there. I am going up soon and having the tractor
fixed. Reggie said he will pay us soon. He also still wants the tractor if
we can hold on to it. First come, first serve.

When is the wedding? We're set for 11/01/01. Be sure to take your sweety
out on the balcony tonight and gaze at the full moon. It was sure beautiful
coming up last night. We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket
and watch for the space shuttle. I had a couple of hickies on my neck the
day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns. Just
jealous.

My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate
within the four year period. She still has some sort of scholarship but I
am not for sure how much it pays. She is going to be a kinesiologist,
sports injury therapist. I think she just wants to be able to touch
football players legs. She will be 20 on 11/03. I am really proud of her.

HEADER_CONTENT Hey Victor,

I am still having trouble reconciling Dec 2000 with New Power. The information they have from their Altra system doesn't seem to tie to what we have in Unify. My contact there, Cris Miceli, seems to think that this gas was flowed on our contracts back then. Therefore , they have no pipe stmts to reconcile to. I was wondering if you would take a look at the deals they show to see what's missing. It looks like they have about $4M in deals that we purchased from them that we don't show in our system. If you'll call me I give you more details. I'd like to resolve this matter ASAP. Your help would be greatly appreciated. I am going to request pipe stmts from Sherry Anastas to support our numbers, but I need your help to see if these deals that they show look like good deals.

Kim,

I am in the process of assigning this customer to a new marketer. A
review of the file shows a recent correspondence concerning tariff gas
purchased by Arma between Kurt Marburger & Charlie Dalphon. Are you able to
shed any light on the issue? There is a significant outstanding balance and
I
believe the customer has made the decision to stop payment until credits
are
issued for the tariff charges.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

HEADER_CONTENT Scott--The volumes delivered into Central Hudson off Iroquois for Arma
Textiles
was included in Exhibit 1 of the 12/99 Energy Purchase Agreement such that it
would appear that Enron would be supplying this gas to CES.  However, the gas
to supply Arma was already purchased from Duke Energy, and as far as I can
tell, Enron has had nothing to do with delivering this gas, and Duke Energy
has
billed us directly for the gas that they supply each month.

I discussed this with Chris Germany, and we agreed that CES would just deal
directly with Duke Energy on this and leave Enron out of it.  Accordingly,
if
you look at the May'00 first-of-the-month request that I sent to Enron on
April
24, the table does show 135 dth/day into Central Hudson off Iroquois.
However,
the table notes that this gas is being supplied by Duke Energy and therefore
no
volumes are being requested from Enron.

Please let me know if this needs further action or clarification.

Thanks.

Subject: Post-Close Storage Settlement


Tim--With regard to the Post-Close Storage Settlement between NPC and CES, the
situation is that we are waiting on final, correct invoices from ENA showing
the volumes injected for the 4 theoretical storages (TCO, Transco WSS, Transco
ESS, and Sonat CSS).  We would also like ENA to agree in some written format
as to the July 31 volumes in each of these storages, where these volumes
reflect the April 1 starting inventory that was left over from last winter.
If
these final numbers from ENA agree with the values that Jeff Porter put in the
latest version of the storage exhibit to the purchase agreement, that is
fine.  To the extent that ENA has invoiced CES for a different amount(s), CES
will resolve those differences with ENA. (We know that there are some
differences, as shown in the attached spreadsheet.)

I have asked Chris Germany at ENA to work with us to get this resolved, and he
has agreed to do so. However, it might help expedite things if you can weigh
in with Chris or with Colleen Sullivan as well.  Please let me know if you
have questions, etc. I am going to be out of the office for at least the next
few days, but I will be checking my e-mail and voice messages periodically.

list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2: The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue. Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3. Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.  Here is what is happening: Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.  We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers. So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items. That's problem one. Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations. We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want). For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.  I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4. Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you. Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges. This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. Let us know what
you would prefer. Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29. Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7. I apologize for the delay.

5. Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday. Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
balances.

withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31. Otherwise, we could be liable
for
penalties.  Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary
and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further.

What's the final answer.... do you need the enduser gas or do you want me
to cut the enduser gas?

If you really need the enduser gas... the only other option is for me...
is to beg TCO to let me inject some pool gas into storage for that gas day
to avoid the $10 withdrawal penalty... but we would still incur the overrun
charge plus the additional overrun charge to get the gas into storage. Need
a decision by 1 pm CST time on Monday, January 31st. Thank you!!!!

Please pass this note to Melissa... still don't have her e-mail address.

Can't wait for it to warm up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: TCO STOW Overage - 1/24

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted
amount (+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was
over-withdrawn. Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage
over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the
weekend. If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the
storage over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please
tell me what you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is
still feeling generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try
to cause unnecessary pain.

HEADER_CONTENT Sent a retro request to TCO last week with two options:

1) Inject into storage from CES IPP pool, which was long that day.
2) In ground storage transfer from Dayton's FSS storage to CES's FSS storage.
Dayton has given Enron the approval to move this storage.

I told TCO the second option would be the most viable option, and it should
not comprise TCO's position with its other shippers.

As of right now, TCO has put all retro requests on hold. The bills will
probably go out with these penalties on it. However, TCO will revisit the
penalty issue, once the dust has settled. We are not the only shipper that
incurred penalties, and TCO wants to treat everyone fairly. I did tell TCO to
remember that Enron is not an affiliate, and TCO needs to treat Enron as TCO
would its other shippers.

Subject: Re: COH Storage Withdrawals


Okay.... to ensure we are all on the same page. We will try to hit your
48,000/day for the last 6 days. The nom's were redone for 2/24.

Because choice burns are so low... I'll nominate about 33,000/day of the
choice burn directly from storage. Joann Collins will use about 15,000/day
to other CES Enduser Market. Just remember, we are at the mercy of mother
nature. When the actuals arrive.... we balance off storage. So if it gets
colder than the forecast, the storage withdrawal will increase. If it gets
warmer, the storage withdrawal will decrease.

If for some reason you want to change this 48,000/day target... just let me
know by 10 EST. This will allow enough time to switch the nom's.

Dick Jenkins and Chris Germany will review if they want "CES to sell back
flowing gas to Enron in order to maintain the storage withdrawal at this
level." (quoted from your other e-mail).

Do you know your March target number for storage withdrawal??? I can
provide your storage balance if needed. Remember, that operationally.... I
use the storage to keep your choice burn balanced with choice actuals.

Thank you!!!!

Joan--I got your voicemail regarding the current daily requirement for COH
Choice.  I understand that you won't be able to pull the 48,000 dth/day
from
storage if the load requirement is below that level.  I anticipate that we
may
be in that situation for at least the next few days, and I will check with
Kara
regarding the burn levels in the future.  We'll figure out day by day how
much
we want to pull and we'll get that to you prior to your 10am EST nom

HEADER_CONTENT Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

HEADER_CONTENT First, I wanted to follow up yesterday's question on GELP meter reading and
how
Enron gets this information in the future. I can't provide a direct answer to
this question, but can provide a contact at Columbia Gas of Virginia to
discuss
the situation.  Lisa Jesse is the Industrial Account Rep. (at 804-323-5343)
and quite familiar with GELP. I am making her aware of the transition and
will
briefly discuss the options available. You should probably make contact for
more relating to LDC information and equipment.

Also, I wanted to forward some examples of the fuel oil information we handle.
The "02 2000 GELP BY VENDOR" and "1999_2000 Winter Oil Orders" will give you
an
idea of where we actually stand as of this morning and where I am in the
February tracking process. On the "02 2000 GELP BY VENDOR" attachment you
will
see delivery by delivery, plant Vs BOL (transporter delivery tickets) and a
summary sheet that identifies any discrepancies fairly quickly. We are
provided the actual delivery tickets via mail, from the Plant (weekly), and
maintain those records. The paragraph below is basically a repeat from the
original note, but I wanted to make sure the information wasn't missed.



We are responsible for the procurement, coordination and tracking of their
fuel
oil activities through the winter period. We've relied on CITGO, BPAmoco and
Marathon Ashland to provide the bulk of our oil supplies in the past. The
only
means of transporting oil to this facility is truck and the above suppliers
have been good about coordinating delivery to the facility. GELP has a 5
million gallon oil tank on site and need to maintain 4.5 million gallons of
inventory through the winter period (FLASH... due to oil prices and
availability, this is under consideration). The Plant has very specific
requirements prior to accepting delivery from any supplier... they demand a
specific 'Sulfur content' test (ASTM D-2622 test) be performed, sent, and
approved by Plant personnel prior to allowing any transporters into their
facility. I have also included basic fax covers sent during this process
including the actual confirmation of placing the order, having the appropriate
oil testing and then faxing the test results to the Plant upon receiving them
from suppliers.

Again, let us know if you need anything further. Thanks.

going to work? Also, Kim saved these documents in the same directory that
Joan put all the last documents in (in the GELP directory) and she has also
printed them out. If you want hard copies, just ask her. Just for the
record, the good news is that the winter is almost over and that seems to be
when most of the work under this contract occurs--once the summer is here
there is a back to back deal with Duke for gas supplies. The other good news
is that it looks like you all will get the opportunity to learn quite a bit
about fuel oil. The bad news is that there doesn't seem to be too much up
side in this deal. The $5,000 monthly fee is about all you get unless you
can get gas to them between November and February and receive your $.05 fee
on that volume.

Anyway, CES is planning on our taking over both the GELP and CALP contracts
the first week of March. This will give us 3 weeks of administering it and
asking all of our questions before the CES contacts are no longer there.
This means we need to very quickly decide who is going to prepare which
reports, how exactly we will handle the fuel oil deliveries (will the gas or
fuel oil guys handle this?), meter reading, contact lists, etc,  I realize
it is bid week and very difficult to get you all together, but I'd like to
have a quick meeting on Monday, February 28 at 11:00 am in Room 3125B to
discuss the GELP and CALP contracts. Please let me know if you cannot make
it. Thank you.

HEADER_CONTENT We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430. The volume is 34,248
dts and the price is $2.22.
I did not Bill CES for this deal. According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the
gas and we paid it back in January. Tom said CES was going to pay us for
this. Should I bill the Retail group for this? It looks more like a
wholesale transaction.
EMAIL_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Before I respond to Chris on this, it brings up a question. I know we
included the cost of the parking service in the true up, but what about the
value of the gas? If gas was parked, then we received free gas---did we
account for this somewhere in the deal (i.e., it should be a positive to
ENA)? If so, then the question on the sale of this gas is simple--was it a
one day swing sale to CES-Retail or was it part of the base load package,
then bill that price accordingly. If we got the gas for free, then that's a
different story.

Please let me know what was booked for this deal.  Thanks.

Clarissa, what did you find out about me receiving different volumes at Boston
than what I requested. We are penalized for over or under deliveries to that
pool. We are now in "critical day" status, which means that we are charged 5
times the daily index, which is GDA plus some other charges. It is very
important that I receive exactly the volume requested. Please talk with the
shipper and ask that they adjust the volume each day as requested.

I know that these are small voumes, but we have to play by the rules.

Day 1, requested 75, received 82
Day 2, requested 97, received 100
day 3, requested 87


For the weekend, I have changes only going to the Boston meter.

Just got off of the phone with Enron.  Due to the meter bounce that they are
doing because of the restriction, there will be a reduction @ the gate (meter
#52) of 370 dth.  Donna, you originally requested 2050 dth, it will now be
1680 dth.  I have been told that you should see the entire 1680 dth.
Unfortunately, you will have to redo your Boston noms.

Need your assistance.  Obviously I need your expertise on Tennessee (and
someone's on Transco).  We need to get gas to S. Ct. and Ct. Natural
citygates
for February.

Here's a what if...........I just spoke with a Tennessee rep to ask about
Transco Rivervale and Tennessee.  They are currently allowing short hauls at
this point.   However, could we bring in some Transco at Rivervale and do a
short haul on Tennessee Mawaw (spelling)?  As of today I was told it could
flow to the above citygate meters.  (although this could change overnight).
I know we did this a few times last winter also.

How does Transco look for this?  As you can tell I am not even aware of the
economics.  If this would work what would it cost? Can you check with Chris
(I don't know his e-mail address)?

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers. The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume
of
the increase. That is an estimate. Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

HEADER_CONTENT The deal 226556 with volume of 4991 was billed and paid separately. Volume
was supposed to be 5000 (B&B still wants the 9 difference). I just talked
to John Singer and he is checking with B&B and with National Fuel Gas for
some paper. He also indicated that this citygate gas was nommed into CES's
pool. If so, someone should be billing CES for it .


WRP










Victor and Robert,
Please let us know if you can be of any help on this one. The only deal with
volumes that I see for Beldan and Blake is deal 226556 and it appears to have
been netted with a CES deal 235398, in which case there would be nothing in
navigator. The deal that I believe Wade is referring to is 345224, but it is
showing a zero volume in unify.

Terry, I see several deals out there for Beldan and Blake all at NYSEG but
with different prices. The only one with volume is 226556 for a total volume
of 4991. Is possible that all the volume may have been put on the one deal
and should have been spread amongst the several deals?

Thanks!

Kathy

Subject: Belden & Blake May-00 NFGD PA Invoice

Volume Management (Angel Fuller), has been unable to locate any volumes for
Belden & Blake for May-00 NFGD PA (National Fuel Gas) gas under Columbia Gas
Transmission. She researched her actuals and looked on Columbia Navigator
under ENA and NFGD PA and was unable to find volumes as invoiced. B&B is
invoicing for 1302 mcf. The Sitara deal that was used for March used CGAS
Point 21 NYSEG 02 Constrained Citygate and has pricing of $3.30 as per the
invoice.

Can you give us any more clues as to where we might find this gas? Some
place else on Navigator? Can B&B supply us with some kind of statement?

Please let me know.

Thanks WRP

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.  However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.  They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.   When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.  I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.  I
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.  I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.  I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.  She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.  She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).  I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.  However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.  I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short, we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).  Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

HEADER_CONTENT In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John
Singer). Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

The price is IF CGAS + $.0175 + Variable Cost + $.02 demand (if we use ENA

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.  Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.  I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.   We will
need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.  This large swing is normal
for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

HEADER_CONTENT To ensure everyone is on the same page. TCO schedulers are still using CES
accounts, because several agency deals' paperwork has not been signed to give
Enron the rights to nominate the gas.

That means that CES can still look at TCO scheduling activities. CES did not
realize they had this access until recently. Noel Bartlo is in Herndon, and
is teaching this group how to manage its assets. TCO told me that CES is
still looking at how we are scheduling our gas.

BOTTOM LINE.... We need everyone's help to get this paperwork signed and
processed... so we can stop CES's ability to look at Enron's nominations.

Calp is not listed below, since it is a wholesale deal. If we can get Calp
processed, we can start using Enron's account. I could eliminate CES's
account access to Enron and Calp. I would still have access to CES's account
for the other agency nominations until the paperwork signed. The other agency
nominations are currently low maintenance.

Brian, correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is the deal you did with Craig
Taylor. Is this deal for more than 1 month?

Victor, Joann, I remember not putting in a deal ticket because I thought it
was
included in the first of the month numbers and we were going to treat this as
a
financial deal. Ask Scott Goodell to put it in. I can't get into our lovely
Sitara system and hopefully I will be gone before you guys get in today.

Joann, if this gas will not flow on secondary transport from the pool for the
10th and the 11th, call my pager and leave a voicemail. Also, if there are no
constraints and CES can take this gas over a couple of days (I know this will
not work for 7-5) then do that instead of prorating through the rest of the
month.

I need legal and credit sign-off for ENA to pre-pay Reliant for gas needed to perform under the City of Tallahassee contract (approx $25 MM in the money to Enron).

The pre-pay would be for 2,000 mmbtu/day x 5 days x Gas Daily +.05 (appox $2.25) = $22,500

This would give us 5 days worth of swing gas pre-paid with Reliant.

Questions:
Are you concerned about Credit?
Are you concerned about the risk they may take our money and not perform by claiming an offset against other monies owed by ENA?
Kay, where can I find you to get you the contract to review?

Please get back to us today as we need to get the "Cash Approval Sheet" to the credit committee this afternoon.

Subject: GELP questions



I have a couple of questions about the GELP contract. First, in the
agreement's
Attachment A, there are several fuel contracts agreements listed that GELP has
(or had) in place with various counterparties. I'm wondering what the status
of
these agreements is--have they expired, are they still in place, etc. These
agreements are:
Purchase Agreements:
Union Pacific Fuels--I understand that this is the Duke contract that
currently supplies GELP--Can we get a copy of this agreement?
Tejas Power Corporation--Expired ???
Columbia Energy Services Corporation dated 1/15/96 - Expired ???
Storage Agreements
Columbia Gas Transmission SIT #41825 - Status ??
Transportation Agreements
CGT-IT agreement #41828 - I'm assuming this is the agreement used to get
gas to GELP--is Duke or CES agent on this?
Commonwealth Gas Services - same question as CGT IT agreement
Note: According to the billing calculations, it appears that the
Duke
supply arrangement must have some
FT transport--whose name is that in?
Other Contracts
Transco - to be acquired - Is there an IT agreement on Transco that is
used? If so, we need contract # and is someone agent on the transport?

Also, in the GELP agreement you indicated that you get real time meter
information from a Bristol RTU. How will ENA get this meter information?

Also, just in general--could you explain your perspective on the value
proposition in this agreement? I understand that there is a $5000 fee you
receive each month that accompanies alot of reporting responsibilities. Since
the data you provided for last year showed very little gas deliveries in the
"winter period" (where you would receive $.05/MMBtu additional compensation),
there doesn't seem to be much up side value there.  Are there other values
you
see to this deal that we may be missing?

Thanks for your assistance.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index

ANR Gets Green Light for Transco Interconnect

ANR Pipeline last week won a two-year battle at FERC to build a direct
interconnect to Transcontinental
Gas Pipe Line's mainline facilities at Evangeline Parish, LA --- near
the site of an active natural gas sales
market.

On rehearing, the Commission upheld a July 1998 order granting a
complaint in which ANR accused
Transco of discriminating against it by denying a request to construct
minor interconnection facilities that
would provide its shippers with direct access to gas sales markets on
Transco's system at Evangeline.

Specifically, the Coastal Corp. pipeline has fought to obtain a direct
connection to Station 50, which is one
of several compressor stations on Transco's mainline serving as pooling
points. There, producers and
marketers sell gas to LDCs and other buyers who hold firm capacity on
Transco for shipment to
downstream markets. The gas sale market at Station 50 is said to be a
"premium one."

In order to get their gas to Station 50 now, ANR shippers must deliver
gas via ANR's existing
interconnection on Transco's Central Louisiana Lateral at Eunice, LA,
and then purchase interruptible
transportation (IT) service on Transco for a distance of about 7.4
miles. So, in effect, ANR shippers
currently must pay "stacked rates" for service on ANR's existing
interconnect and for service on Transco's
IT feeder to reach Station 50.

But the Commission last week found that ANR's request for a direct
interconnection at Evangeline was
reasonable under three different analyses. "First, the evidence shows
that Transco has provided no
reasonable justification for denying ANR's request, given Transco's
history of granting such requests made
by similarly situated parties," the order said [CP98-74]. Six pipelines
other than ANR currently have direct
interconnections on Transco's mainline in the Gulf region that were
established prior to Transco's
restructuring under Order 636, and none of the shippers pay an IT rate
in order to get gas to Transco's
mainline markets, according to the order.

Secondly, evidence suggests the denial of an interconnection for ANR
has led to "specific competitive harm
to the operations of sales markets on Transco's mainline," the
Commission said. That's because buyers at
Station 50 have been barred access to the competitively priced gas
supplies that ANR's shippers seek to
offer, FERC noted. Lastly, it said the establishment of the Evangeline
interconnect for ANR was required
under the new five-step interconnection policy for gas pipelines, which
FERC unveiled last week.

In upholding the July 1998 decision, the Commission overturned an
administrative law judge's (ALJ) initial
findings that competition hadn't been adversely harmed at Station 50,
and that FERC's prior approval of the
IT feeder system provided "appropriate support" for Transco to deny ANR
the Evangeline interconnect.

"We are persuaded by the record in this case that ANR cannot offer a
pipeline transportation service
reasonably competitive with those provided by Transco and other
interstate pipelines, without the
Evangeline interconnect, a minor facility consisting of valve access to
Transco's mainline," the order
concluded.

The Commission also rejected Transco's claim that it partly denied
ANR's request for the Evangeline
interconnect because it would have led to a revenue loss on its IT
Feeder system. As the FERC staff noted,
"six other interstate pipelines currently use mainline interconnects
[on Transco].....but no evidence indicates
the extent of even arguably identifiable business loss from these
pipeline competitors," the order noted. If
anything, "Transco has accorded itself an anti-competitive
preference.....to assure that its own IT service is
used in lieu of the potential alternative proposed by ANR."

need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.  This large swing is normal
for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Brian, correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is the deal you did with Craig
Taylor. Is this deal for more than 1 month?

Victor, Joann, I remember not putting in a deal ticket because I thought it
was
included in the first of the month numbers and we were going to treat this as
a
financial deal. Ask Scott Goodell to put it in. I can't get into our lovely
Sitara system and hopefully I will be gone before you guys get in today.

Joann, if this gas will not flow on secondary transport from the pool for the
10th and the 11th, call my pager and leave a voicemail. Also, if there are no
constraints and CES can take this gas over a couple of days (I know this will
not work for 7-5) then do that instead of prorating through the rest of the
month.

Sorry guys!!

HEADER_CONTENT Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

HEADER_CONTENT After reviewing the Action Items from 07/17/2000 and more thoroughly analyzing the =01&validation task=018 assigned to John Singer and myself, w e have changed our approach. Instead, I recruited Jeanne Wukasch to help pull together a more effective strategy and assist with the cleanup process. We are calling on Jim Javin and John Singer to rule only on exceptions or conflicts in data. Also, we are meeting with Logistics and IT to establish a workable solution to clear-up paths with more than one deal. Our review of the Appalachian data is based primarily on wellhead activity from the following sources:

Path Manager Supply =01) This gives us the ability to sort data easily, pro vide views of deals and path relationships. This screen allows us to identify duplicate deals under the same meter and incorrect trading desk assignments . We can also trace purchase information to the transport detail.
Unify Transaction List =01) This is an extract of Apr-00 production data ou t of Unify Purchase and Transport files. This list permits us to compare purcha se price deducts vs. transport payments by meter. (Manual payments and the inconsistencies in the Unify set-up of pipe structures will require additional effort in this area.) The end result of our efforts will provid e:

a deal reference for meters listed more than once
consolidation of wellhead deals by pipe
correct Market East regional designation
purchase deducts not corresponding to pipeline payments
meters without purchase payments
incorrect price adjustments for transport cost

A status update has been scheduled for August 15 at 1 PM in room EB 3014.  Our goal is to have completed Gatherco and CNR wellheads. To date our progress has revealed:

Meters with multiple deals   73
Meters not on Market East deals  167
Different counter-parties with the same meter  13
Deducts missing from the purchase price  47
Purchase prices with incorrect deducts  85

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn.
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend.
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to
cause unnecessary pain.

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago,
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented
capacity. Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement
shipper. Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not)
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible. For instance,
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on
Iroquois' system? Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments
on this issue. I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

HEADER_CONTENT It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen. We recogniz e that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w e are pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success through Enron stock options.
As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t he All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu e to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program.
Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid ed to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib le on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran t of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O ption Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program. To provide information and answer your question s, we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo ur Human Resources representative.
Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant ing of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal regulatory requirements. It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enr on companies=01, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business issues. As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the marketplaces we serve. Given that need to change, we will continue to refi ne the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being determined on December 29, 2000.

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the
application.

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons:
(1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names
into the group.
(2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the
messages after typing the
messages into the text box:
(1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
(2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second.
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10
second. Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

Stonestreet, Julie Watkins, and Brian Adams, verbally on the phone.

Enron should have a total of 800,000 on gas control's books over May's MMIQ.
Joann needs a total of 822,000 to overinject for the month. Per my

total of 822,000. Mike will let us know if the incremental 22,000 has been

Need your assistance.  Obviously I need your expertise on Tennessee (and
someone's on Transco).  We need to get gas to S. Ct. and Ct. Natural
citygates
for February.

Here's a what if...........I just spoke with a Tennessee rep to ask about
Transco Rivervale and Tennessee.  They are currently allowing short hauls at
this point.   However, could we bring in some Transco at Rivervale and do a
short haul on Tennessee Mawaw (spelling)?  As of today I was told it could
flow to the above citygate meters.  (although this could change overnight).
I know we did this a few times last winter also.

How does Transco look for this?  As you can tell I am not even aware of the
economics.  If this would work what would it cost? Can you check with Chris
(I don't know his e-mail address)?

You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type. Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible. For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it. I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one). Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up. I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please
advise.

Cindy & Chris,
I have sold the Equitrans metered production flowing into our Equitrans pool
for a one year period to Dominion Field Services beginning November 1, 2000.
Dominion will take whatever the Equitrans monthly estimate is. I will do the
deal sheet and have Terry Franklin input into Sitara.

HEADER_CONTENT Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up
under 2 desk, Market East and East. All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco,
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes
away on 4/1, or East. So even on these pipes you will probably see the same
contract under both desk.

I really don't want to go down the road of putting together any more side

ENA confirming the storage volume. You can use this as a basis to complete
your billing reconciliations. I will promise to forward to you all of the
volume confirmations that we have with ENA for July 31 injections.

Colleen;
I don't have your view. If you want to do a side letter, as was completed
for the hedges, let us know. However, if you all don't feel strongly about
this, then I am inclined to carry on as I described above.

Subject: Post-Close Storage Settlement


Tim--With regard to the Post-Close Storage Settlement between NPC and CES, the
situation is that we are waiting on final, correct invoices from ENA showing
the volumes injected for the 4 theoretical storages (TCO, Transco WSS, Transco
ESS, and Sonat CSS).  We would also like ENA to agree in some written format
as to the July 31 volumes in each of these storages, where these volumes
reflect the April 1 starting inventory that was left over from last winter.
If
these final numbers from ENA agree with the values that Jeff Porter put in the
latest version of the storage exhibit to the purchase agreement, that is
fine.  To the extent that ENA has invoiced CES for a different amount(s), CES
will resolve those differences with ENA. (We know that there are some
differences, as shown in the attached spreadsheet.)

I have asked Chris Germany at ENA to work with us to get this resolved, and he
has agreed to do so. However, it might help expedite things if you can weigh
in with Chris or with Colleen Sullivan as well.  Please let me know if you
have questions, etc. I am going to be out of the office for at least the next
few days, but I will be checking my e-mail and voice messages periodically.

Thanks.

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.  However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.  They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.   When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.  I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.  I
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.  I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.  I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.  She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.  She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).  I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.  However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.  I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short, we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).  Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Subject: CKY 6-12 January 2000 - cut 29th 767 dth

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.  However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.  They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.   When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.  I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.  I
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.  I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.  I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.  She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.  She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).  I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.  However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.  I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short, we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).  Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

HEADER_CONTENT cc:

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool
EMAIL_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
Phillips  Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you
can anwser this.

EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2: The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue. Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3. Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.  Here is what is happening: Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.  We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers. So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items. That's problem one. Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations. We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want). For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.  I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4. Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you. Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges. This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. Let us know what
you would prefer. Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29. Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7. I apologize for the delay.

5. Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday. Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
balances.

Subject: TRANSCO PROPRIETARY FILE

Dave,

As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES
contracts as well
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union. Our proprietary file contacts the
business party id, rather
than the DUNS number. Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's
business party id. These
are the valid business parties we use:

ENA  5304
Brooklyn Union  21995
Columbia Energy Services 5092
Columbia Energy Marketing 7772

As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various
producers, we will
need to include their business parties as well. For now, this is all we
need. In the meantime,
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert
into Unify as do not
send??

Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking. We spend a
great deal of time
overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity to
be cut as we need
it. Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swing
activity to 899??

Thanks for you help.

sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you
please assist?

1. TCO K#64651-is it CES' or ENA's? delivers to CMD4-25
2. TCO COH7-1, Exhibit 1 shows 20,000 of capacity for C&I. I have no details

this K.
3. TCO K#62164- I believe it delivers to COH7-4, but I have no details.
4. TCO K#65403- believe it delivers 19,000+ to BGE, but need all detail.
5. CNG NORTH- K#'s 5A2291/5A2181 and 5A2292/5A2182; deliveries to NIMO, CES's
or ENA's?
6. Have a bunch of contracts to TETCO M3, CES or ENA? see below

7. TRANSCO Z5-Ex 1 shows 150 capacity, I have no details.
8. TRANSCO Z6- for LILCO, is this released monthly to ENA?

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type. Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago,
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented
capacity. Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement
shipper. Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not)
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible. For instance,
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on
Iroquois' system? Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments
on this issue. I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

account for this somewhere in the deal (i.e., it should be a positive to
ENA)? If so, then the question on the sale of this gas is simple--was it a
one day swing sale to CES-Retail or was it part of the base load package,
then bill that price accordingly. If we got the gas for free, then that's a
different story.

145321 = 10,000
This ticket has been used for the total 10,000. This may be incorrect. (April

how
Enron gets this information in the future. I can't provide a direct answer to
this question, but can provide a contact at Columbia Gas of Virginia to
discuss
the situation.  Lisa Jesse is the Industrial Account Rep. (at 804-323-5343)
and quite familiar with GELP. I am making her aware of the transition and
will
briefly discuss the options available. You should probably make contact for
more relating to LDC information and equipment.

Also, I wanted to forward some examples of the fuel oil information we handle.
The "02 2000 GELP BY VENDOR" and "1999_2000 Winter Oil Orders" will give you
an
idea of where we actually stand as of this morning and where I am in the
February tracking process. On the "02 2000 GELP BY VENDOR" attachment you
will
see delivery by delivery, plant Vs BOL (transporter delivery tickets) and a
summary sheet that identifies any discrepancies fairly quickly. We are
provided the actual delivery tickets via mail, from the Plant (weekly), and
maintain those records. The paragraph below is basically a repeat from the
original note, but I wanted to make sure the information wasn't missed.



We are responsible for the procurement, coordination and tracking of their
fuel
oil activities through the winter period. We've relied on CITGO, BPAmoco and
Marathon Ashland to provide the bulk of our oil supplies in the past. The
only
means of transporting oil to this facility is truck and the above suppliers
have been good about coordinating delivery to the facility. GELP has a 5
million gallon oil tank on site and need to maintain 4.5 million gallons of
inventory through the winter period (FLASH... due to oil prices and
availability, this is under consideration). The Plant has very specific
requirements prior to accepting delivery from any supplier... they demand a
specific 'Sulfur content' test (ASTM D-2622 test) be performed, sent, and
approved by Plant personnel prior to allowing any transporters into their
facility. I have also included basic fax covers sent during this process
including the actual confirmation of placing the order, having the appropriate
oil testing and then faxing the test results to the Plant upon receiving them
from suppliers.

Again, let us know if you need anything further. Thanks.

can get gas to them between November and February and receive your $.05 fee
on that volume.

Anyway, CES is planning on our taking over both the GELP and CALP contracts
the first week of March. This will give us 3 weeks of administering it and
asking all of our questions before the CES contacts are no longer there.
This means we need to very quickly decide who is going to prepare which
reports, how exactly we will handle the fuel oil deliveries (will the gas or
fuel oil guys handle this?), meter reading, contact lists, etc,  I realize
it is bid week and very difficult to get you all together, but I'd like to
have a quick meeting on Monday, February 28 at 11:00 am in Room 3125B to
discuss the GELP and CALP contracts. Please let me know if you cannot make
it. Thank you.

FYI -- Press Release received this morning:

Cove Point LNG to Begin Open Season Process For Capacity at its LNG Receiving
Terminal
?
02/16/2000
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2000, PR Newswire)

HERNDON, Va, Feb. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a
subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, announced today that it will conduct an
open season from February 16 to March 16, 2000, for a firm LNG tanker
discharging service at its Cove Point LNG terminal. The new service will
include the unloading of LNG from tankers, LNG storage, vaporization, and
delivery of natural gas to points along Cove Point's existing pipeline.

Cove Point LNG is offering 750,000 dekatherms per day of deliverability and
4.25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of vapor equivalent storage capacity initially.
The service includes a proposed expansion of the available storage capacity
to 6.75 Bcf approximately one year after the start-up of the LNG receiving
operations. Pending approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
Cove Point LNG plans to begin the LNG tanker discharging service by late
2001.

Located in Lusby, Md., the Cove Point LNG terminal includes liquefied natural
gas storage and terminal operations, and an 87-mile natural gas pipeline that
connects with gas pipelines in Northern Virginia. The terminal has installed
send-out capacity of 1 Bcf of gas per day. With the proposed storage
expansion, total LNG storage at Cove Point will be 7.5 Bcf of vapor
equivalent natural gas. The Cove Point LNG terminal currently provides "peak
shaving" services to customers in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions.

Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading
energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its
operating companies engage in virtually all phases of the natural gas
business, including exploration and production, transmission, storage and
distribution, as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum
product sales, and electric power generation. Information about Columbia
Energy Group (NYSE: CG) is available on the Internet at
www.columbiaenergygroup.com.

of the Federal securities laws, including statements concerning, on a
consolidated, segment or subsidiary basis, Columbia's plans, objectives and
expected performance. There can be no assurance that actual results will not
differ materially due to various factors, many of which are beyond the

Colleen,

Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling
daily:

CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16
CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their
intra-month curve at.
TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10

Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one
day lag. After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any
derived curves.
If you have any questions please let me know.

FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as
possible. This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible. I'm not sure how you or
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating
transport p&l. In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas. These could
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates. The
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES
business in our portfolio, the times have changed. Currently we are using
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and
how we are marking the curves. For example, today's Gas Daily postings
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY  GAS DAILY SPREAD  SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985  $1.565   $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39  $ .585   $.16
CNG South $3.305  $ .670   $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong. There are
two solutions that I see. One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace. That's up to you.
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it),
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

you recall, one contract is to COH for 20,000/d through 10/31/00 (#65402);
the other is to BG&E for 19,000/d through 4/01(#65403). This is the
information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me--you need to confirm that
this information is accurate.

I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest

HEADER_CONTENT cc:

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2: The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue. Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3. Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.  Here is what is happening: Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.  We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers. So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items. That's problem one. Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations. We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want). For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.  I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4. Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you. Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges. This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. Let us know what
you would prefer. Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29. Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7. I apologize for the delay.

5. Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday. Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.  Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.  I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 markets until Monday, 12/27. We will need a
range from 2800 dth to 3600 dth per day.  This large swing is normal for

HEADER_CONTENT To ensure everyone is on the same page. TCO schedulers are still using CES
accounts, because several agency deals' paperwork has not been signed to give
Enron the rights to nominate the gas.

That means that CES can still look at TCO scheduling activities. CES did not
realize they had this access until recently. Noel Bartlo is in Herndon, and
is teaching this group how to manage its assets. TCO told me that CES is
still looking at how we are scheduling our gas.

BOTTOM LINE.... We need everyone's help to get this paperwork signed and
processed... so we can stop CES's ability to look at Enron's nominations.

Calp is not listed below, since it is a wholesale deal. If we can get Calp
processed, we can start using Enron's account. I could eliminate CES's
account access to Enron and Calp. I would still have access to CES's account
for the other agency nominations until the paperwork signed. The other agency
nominations are currently low maintenance.

Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as
possible. This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible. I'm not sure how you or
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating
transport p&l. In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas. These could
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates. The
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES
business in our portfolio, the times have changed. Currently we are using
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and
how we are marking the curves. For example, today's Gas Daily postings
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY  GAS DAILY SPREAD  SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985  $1.565   $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39  $ .585   $.16
CNG South $3.305  $ .670   $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong. There are
two solutions that I see. One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace. That's up to you.
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it),
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

HEADER_KEYWORDS capacity brooklyn trader pipelines firm
HEADER_SUBJECT  
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Vince and Vasant:

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for
overhead expenses. A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 . The trader's spread is
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity.
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet). For South Texas and
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc). And, once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

purchased by Arma between Kurt Marburger & Charlie Dalphon. Are you able to

HEADER_CONTENT Scott--The volumes delivered into Central Hudson off Iroquois for Arma
Textiles
was included in Exhibit 1 of the 12/99 Energy Purchase Agreement such that it
would appear that Enron would be supplying this gas to CES.  However, the gas
to supply Arma was already purchased from Duke Energy, and as far as I can
tell, Enron has had nothing to do with delivering this gas, and Duke Energy
has
billed us directly for the gas that they supply each month.

I discussed this with Chris Germany, and we agreed that CES would just deal
directly with Duke Energy on this and leave Enron out of it.  Accordingly,
if
you look at the May'00 first-of-the-month request that I sent to Enron on
April
24, the table does show 135 dth/day into Central Hudson off Iroquois.
However,
the table notes that this gas is being supplied by Duke Energy and therefore
no
volumes are being requested from Enron.

Please let me know if this needs further action or clarification.

I have revised Exhibit 1 of the retail supply agreement pursuant to our
meeting
last week. Two changes were made:

1) Tennessee Zone 6 premium for 1/2000 was corrected to +.06.
2) Volume requirements for Choice programs with storage were
reduced in most cases to account for storage gas being withdrawn. These are
the
final volumes.

Subject: GELP questions



I have a couple of questions about the GELP contract. First, in the
agreement's
Attachment A, there are several fuel contracts agreements listed that GELP has
(or had) in place with various counterparties. I'm wondering what the status
of
these agreements is--have they expired, are they still in place, etc. These
agreements are:
Purchase Agreements:
Union Pacific Fuels--I understand that this is the Duke contract that
currently supplies GELP--Can we get a copy of this agreement?
Tejas Power Corporation--Expired ???
Columbia Energy Services Corporation dated 1/15/96 - Expired ???
Storage Agreements
Columbia Gas Transmission SIT #41825 - Status ??
Transportation Agreements
CGT-IT agreement #41828 - I'm assuming this is the agreement used to get
gas to GELP--is Duke or CES agent on this?
Commonwealth Gas Services - same question as CGT IT agreement
Note: According to the billing calculations, it appears that the
Duke
supply arrangement must have some
FT transport--whose name is that in?
Other Contracts
Transco - to be acquired - Is there an IT agreement on Transco that is
used? If so, we need contract # and is someone agent on the transport?

Also, in the GELP agreement you indicated that you get real time meter
information from a Bristol RTU. How will ENA get this meter information?

Also, just in general--could you explain your perspective on the value
proposition in this agreement? I understand that there is a $5000 fee you
receive each month that accompanies alot of reporting responsibilities. Since
the data you provided for last year showed very little gas deliveries in the
"winter period" (where you would receive $.05/MMBtu additional compensation),
there doesn't seem to be much up side value there.  Are there other values
you
see to this deal that we may be missing?

Thanks for your assistance.

Singer). Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

HEADER_CONTENT Actually, the deal is for 773/day @ into CPA via the Carnegie-Jefferson
interconnect. The price is NX1 + $0.12/Dth; the contract expires 11/01/00.
This gas only flowed for a part of February and is not flowing for March.
CPA closed the interconnect with Carnegie for their own needs/system supply.
This gas may not flow for the rest of the contract. CPA will only operate
the interconnect on a day-to-day basis; no firm is available. I am to check
with CPA to see if they will do an exchange for this gas.

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible. For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it. I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one). Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up. I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please
advise.

Clarissa, what did you find out about me receiving different volumes at Boston
than what I requested. We are penalized for over or under deliveries to that
pool. We are now in "critical day" status, which means that we are charged 5
times the daily index, which is GDA plus some other charges. It is very
important that I receive exactly the volume requested. Please talk with the
shipper and ask that they adjust the volume each day as requested.

I know that these are small voumes, but we have to play by the rules.

Day 1, requested 75, received 82
Day 2, requested 97, received 100
day 3, requested 87


For the weekend, I have changes only going to the Boston meter.

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible. For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it. I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one). Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up. I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please
advise.

2001???

The offsetting dollar amount for the 9612 production adjustment
(K#016-21045-306C) was $121,080.16. This adjustment however was reversed
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in
11/97 GL and subsequently written off in 01/98 GL at the time the company was
sold. I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it.

I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we are
going to make to Co.366 ($463,609.20) and the actual dollars in the system
($498,824.82). He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct.

Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what
the amount would be. Thanks,

The 9612 production adjustment received from Transco was a reduction in
volume of (33,517). There was a ($2,734.99) Commodity adjustment and a
($124,582.69) Cash Out adjustment for a total credit from Transco of
($127,317.68). ECT took this credit. This volume adjustment was entered in
the sales system in 10/97 reducing the sales volume to Enron Louisiana from
284,890 to 251,373 on K#016-21045-306C. I don't know what the offsetting
dollar amount would be for the sales adjustment but someone in Client
Services should be able to get this info.

Subject: Enron Louisiana Mtg. 8/3

I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday. Tracy is expecting
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production
month adjustment. What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2) pass it through to
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3)
cut a check to Trans Canada? Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00? I believe it depends on
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999. (Applause
here!) Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled via a manual line item.

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type. For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity. Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting. Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close. The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31. This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara. Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month. For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator. They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
forward.

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting... Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

On Thursday, December 7,2000, IOGA WV and Dominion Transmission (formerly CNG
Transmission) announced that they have reached a five year agreement on
gathering rates. Although this agreement is subject to FERC's approval,
there should be no problem having FERC OK.

This agreement becomes effective January 1, 2001. Under the agreement,
Dominion WILL NOT invoice either the producer or his agent (i.e. ENA) for
gathering or processing. Instead, Dominion will increase the gas retention
percentages to cover the costs of both gathering and processing. They are:

1/1/2001 - 6/30/2003
7/1/2003 - 12/31-2005

Transmission Dry
0                             0
Transmission Wet
3.91%                         3.51%
Gathering Dry
9.34%                          9.34%
Gathering Wet
13.25%                        12.85%

As of yesterday, Dominion was not sure exactly how they will communicate the
production information to the producer and/or his agent. My guess is that
they will send a monthly statement which willl have two volumes for each
meter. The first volume will be the wellhead volume delivered to the meter
(a gross volume) . This volume will be adjusted by the retention percentage
which will equate to the sales volume (gross volume less gathering and/or
processing). The sales volume will be the volume we will pay the producer
for since it will be net of gathering and/or processing. There will be no
additional charges. ENA will not be required send monies to Dominion.

As additional information becomes available, I will forward.

Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00.
There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you
yesterday. Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly
requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes),
the
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were
only
picking up the first 29 days of March. (This spreadsheet was originally
designed for February, which has 29 days.)  This has been corrected in the
attached version.

Sorry for any confusion.

EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total
daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day. This would
be
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing
gas.  On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1,
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31. Otherwise, we could be liable
for
penalties.  Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are
not reflected in the books. Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to
book since there is flexibility in the takes. Also, he said he has a strong
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it. Dick
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now. So Chris
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked. You can do what you want, but
I still think we should book it. The flexibility in takes is only 10% so
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't
book anything. Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to. In addition, per our
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year. This
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term. And finally, what if
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you
want.

Subject: Tribute to the United States
TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES
This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth
sharing. America: The Good Neighbor.
Widespread but only partial news coverage was
given recently to a remarkable editorial
broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a
Canadian television commentator. What follows is
the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed
in the Congressional Record:
"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for
the Americans as the most generous and possibly
the least appreciated people on all the earth.
Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain
and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by
the Americans who poured in billions of dollars
and forgave other billions in debts. None of
these countries is today paying even the interest
on its remaining debts to the United States.
When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956,
it was the Americans who propped it up, and their
reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.
When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the
United States that hurries in to help. This
spring, 59 American communities were flattened by
tornadoes. Nobody helped.
The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped
billions of dollars into discouraged countries.
Now newspapers in those countries are writing
about the decadent, war-mongering Americans.
I'd like to see just one of those countries that
is gloating over the erosion of the United States
dollar build its own airplane. Does any other
country in the world have a plane to equal the
Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the
Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why
do all the International lines except Russia fly
American Planes?
Why does no other land on earth even consider
putting a man or woman on the moon? You talk
about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
You talk about German technocracy, and you get
automobiles.
You talk about American technocracy, and you find
men on the moon - not once, but several times -
and safely home again.
You talk about scandals, and the Americans put
theirs right in the store window for everybody to
look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
and hounded. They are here on our streets, and
most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian
laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa
at home to spend here.
When the railways of France, Germany and India
were breaking down through age, it was the
Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania
Railroad and the New York Central went broke,
nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are
still broke.
I can name you 5000 times when the Americans
raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can
you name me even one time when someone else raced
to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there
was outside help even during the San Francisco
earthquake.
Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one
Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
kicked around. They will come out of this thing
with their flag high. And when they do, they are
entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that
are gloating over their present troubles. I hope
Canada is not one of those."
Stand proud, America!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is one of the best editorials that I have
ever read regarding the United States. It is nice
that one man realizes it. I only wish that the
rest of the world would realize it. We are always
blamed for everything, and never even get a thank
you for the things we do.
I would hope that each of you would send this to
as many people as you can and emphasize that they
should send it to as many of their friends until
this letter is sent to every person on the web. I
am just a single American that has read this, I
SURE HOPE THAT A LOT MORE READ IT SOON.

HEADER_CONTENT Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers. The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume
of
the increase. That is an estimate. Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

FYI. I received a letter today from Ed Arnold with Kriscott Inc. stating
that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000. For
volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month. Let me
know if anyone wants a copy of the letter.

3000 dth. I will try to remind you.

Subject: Re: COH Storage Withdrawals


Okay.... to ensure we are all on the same page. We will try to hit your
48,000/day for the last 6 days. The nom's were redone for 2/24.

Because choice burns are so low... I'll nominate about 33,000/day of the
choice burn directly from storage. Joann Collins will use about 15,000/day
to other CES Enduser Market. Just remember, we are at the mercy of mother
nature. When the actuals arrive.... we balance off storage. So if it gets
colder than the forecast, the storage withdrawal will increase. If it gets
warmer, the storage withdrawal will decrease.

If for some reason you want to change this 48,000/day target... just let me
know by 10 EST. This will allow enough time to switch the nom's.

Dick Jenkins and Chris Germany will review if they want "CES to sell back
flowing gas to Enron in order to maintain the storage withdrawal at this
level." (quoted from your other e-mail).

Do you know your March target number for storage withdrawal??? I can
provide your storage balance if needed. Remember, that operationally.... I
use the storage to keep your choice burn balanced with choice actuals.

Thank you!!!!

Joan--I got your voicemail regarding the current daily requirement for COH
Choice.  I understand that you won't be able to pull the 48,000 dth/day
from
storage if the load requirement is below that level.  I anticipate that we
may
be in that situation for at least the next few days, and I will check with
Kara
regarding the burn levels in the future.  We'll figure out day by day how
much
we want to pull and we'll get that to you prior to your 10am EST nom
deadline.   Don't redo your nom for 2/24; just leave it as is.

Thanks.

list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

Chris--see Melissa's note below.....per her note it would appear that part of
the capacity we valued in the Wholesale book (not Retail) was not really
capacity they owned. Can you give me the details on this capacity--what term
they gave it to us for, rate, receipt and delivery points, volume, etc. Then
we need to look at what impact it will have to take it out of the book.
Thanks for the help.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT 1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
Phillips  Power Gas Marketing
Term

Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you
can anwser this.

Technology has helped Enron create new businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com. You =01,ve seen what technology can do at work. Now we want you and your family to realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t he ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips.
We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000 software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries; however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT , Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business reasons. Eligibility includes being employed at the time of implementation. ? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter. Delive ry of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized. To address some of your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on http://clickathome.enron.com. We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne ar future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.
We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your family. We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve l by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe Enron is a great place to work.

Re: Transco Files a Motion for Modification of Settlement to
??? Permit Interim Partial Refunds
??? Docket Nos. RP97-71-000 and RP97-312-000

In response to certain customers' requests, Transco submits a
Motion for Modification of Settlement to Permit Interim Partial
Refunds in the above-captioned proceedings. By this motion,
Transco requests that the Commission modify Article V of the
January 20, 1998 Stipulation and Agreement to permit Transco to
make an interim partial refund of amount to Non-Contesting
Parties, if any, related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return
Issues on or about October 31, 2000. The refund is being made to
parties in advance of the date that such refunds are due as set
forth in the Stipulation and Agreement, in part to help mitigate
the effects of current high natural gas prices on their
customers. For further detailed information of the Motion filed
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, please refer to
Transco's filing today in the above mentioned dockets.

Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on
or about October 31,2000 to Non-Contesting Parties related to the
Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to
those customers with interest from the date of payment to the
date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May 1, 1997
through February 29,2000 in excess of the amount that would have
been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the
Commission's findings in its March 17, 2000 order in Docket No.
RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues,
subject to the "refund floor". These interim partial refunds will
be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any
supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for
the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon
request.

If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim
partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final
Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital
Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds
related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non-
Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on
or before October 25, 2000, of its election not to participate in
the interim partial refunds.

HEADER_KEYWORDS ferc ldcs argued sfv 637
HEADER_SUBJECT Memo from Shelley Corman: FERC Staff Conference Today
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Today, FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are
necessary to promote further market liquidity. The conference was fairly
well attended by FERC staff, including Dan Larcamp and Shelton Cannon.

Some common themes:
Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not
necessary.
Commodity markets are very liquid.
FERC policies, GISB and Order 637 have helped to make capacity markets more
liquid.
Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in
Order No. 637 compliance filings.
Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity (with pipelines making the
distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea,
standardization of product offerings is not).
There is very little consensus on further areas for change. In nearly every
case, a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another.
In any event, most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes.

Areas without consensus:
Shipper-must-have-title rule. LDCs argue it should be removed; while Process
Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release
market.
Production area rate design. LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy
service downstrream of a market pool. Reliant and Koch also argued that
pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates.
The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area.
SFV. East Coast LDCs, Michcon, and APGA argued for moving off of SFV. The
producers and industrials oppose. Illinois Power/Dynegy also argued for
moving off SFV.


LDC Positions
The LDCs main themes were removing the shipper-must-have-title and enabling
LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers. However, they also argued
that pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric
generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically
enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs .  This is the point that AGA
raised in the blanket intervention to all Order 637 compliance filings.
Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are
entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a
best efforts basis, perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not
have been fully subscribed. LDCs, generally stating that 637 compliance
filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation, continued to stress
the need for segmentation, including "geographical segmentation of ROFR
capacity."

Some Specific Proposals
NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form 2 filings.
A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information,
though specific needs were not well defined.
Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties
(especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for
arbitrage).
Alliance of Energy Suppliers (marketing arm of EEI) called for a dialogue
between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly
variability. They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to
match the power grid (Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to
standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well).
The GISB End-User group (represented by Salt River Project) complained about
the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas
transactions to be "tagged" like electric transactions.

E-Commerce and Capacity Trading
Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity
trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy
transactions, remove posting periods and long contract execution periods. He
made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary.
Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme, admonishing the
FERC not to micro-manage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist
on a single platform. He said that liquidity cannot be legislated. From his
perspective, natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets
in the world. FERC should worry about transferring the "good stuff" from
natural gas to electric markets, not the reverse.

ENA nominated Reliant Energy Field Services contract 96034155 on the third
party pipe for January business. This contract is set up with an effective
date of 02/01/2000 rather than 01/01/2000 in the Global Contracts system. Is
it possible to change the date in the Global Contracts system, or should we
not have used this contract for January business?

Thanks for your help.

FirstEnergy called to change the contract number for the sale I made to them

with Equitable the information John Singer gave to Phil below. For future
reference Fred's number is 412-395-3295. A backup contact at Equitable is
Steve Rafferty, 412-395-3268.

Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective
12/1/99. On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal
141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake. I don't see a sale anywhere to
FirstEnergy.

Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day.
I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.

Yes, the deal needs to be input into Sitata. Maybe, Terry can input. Wade

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are
not reflected in the books. Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to
book since there is flexibility in the takes. Also, he said he has a strong
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it. Dick
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now. So Chris
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.

HEADER_CONTENT cc: Steve Jackson/HOU/ECT@ECT

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked. You can do what you want, but
I still think we should book it. The flexibility in takes is only 10% so
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't
book anything. Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to. In addition, per our
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year. This
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term. And finally, what if
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you
want.

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible. For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it. I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one). Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up. I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please
advise.

for. He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience. He said
he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year. You just never
know. His number is 713-230-7205.

HEADER_CONTENT Hi, Chris! It's good to hear from you.

Thanks for thinking about me. I saw CMS's ad in Sunday's paper for that
position. I sent my resume to them in response to an ad back in December,
and their HR folks called me in early January about an interview. Then the
situation must have changed because then the HR lady acted like they didn't
really have a position to fill after all. I've discovered that most HR
people are really lame (that's the nicest thing I can say!). I'll call Curt
Lizzi; however, I think you're more qualified to trade NE physical than I
am. I'm probably better suited for Gulf Coast.

I've been talking with Reliant and they may have a Gulf Coast position
available soon. I'm not thrilled about some of the people there, but who
knows? Duke may have a Gulf Coast position available because someone
recently quit; however, Renato works there now so I'm SOL. I had a good
interview with them in late January when they didn't have the spot. Since
then, Renato has started with them in their origination group. Timing is
everything!! Guess who Renato's working for? Eric Gonzales, formerly of
Enron fame and fortune. He's Dan's old buddy.

Robin might be interested in the CMS job. Is she still working estate team
at Enron/UBS?? I haven't spoken with her since December. I've had very
little contact with anyone there. My last emails went unanswered, so I
decided to give up.

Good luck with your baby! When is the due date? I know you are both
excited. It will be a real change in lifestyle but not a negative one,
believe me.

Take care,

Susan

HEADER_CONTENT cc:  (bcc: Timothy J Hamilton/HOU/EES)

Subject: Tribute to the United States
TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES
This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth
sharing. America: The Good Neighbor.
Widespread but only partial news coverage was
given recently to a remarkable editorial
broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a
Canadian television commentator. What follows is
the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed
in the Congressional Record:
"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for
the Americans as the most generous and possibly
the least appreciated people on all the earth.
Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain
and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by
the Americans who poured in billions of dollars
and forgave other billions in debts. None of
these countries is today paying even the interest
on its remaining debts to the United States.
When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956,
it was the Americans who propped it up, and their
reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.
When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the
United States that hurries in to help. This
spring, 59 American communities were flattened by
tornadoes. Nobody helped.
The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped
billions of dollars into discouraged countries.
Now newspapers in those countries are writing
about the decadent, war-mongering Americans.
I'd like to see just one of those countries that
is gloating over the erosion of the United States
dollar build its own airplane. Does any other
country in the world have a plane to equal the
Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the
Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why
do all the International lines except Russia fly
American Planes?
Why does no other land on earth even consider
putting a man or woman on the moon? You talk
about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
You talk about German technocracy, and you get
automobiles.
You talk about American technocracy, and you find
men on the moon - not once, but several times -
and safely home again.
You talk about scandals, and the Americans put
theirs right in the store window for everybody to
look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
and hounded. They are here on our streets, and
most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian
laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa
at home to spend here.
When the railways of France, Germany and India
were breaking down through age, it was the
Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania
Railroad and the New York Central went broke,
nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are
still broke.
I can name you 5000 times when the Americans
raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can
you name me even one time when someone else raced
to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there
was outside help even during the San Francisco
earthquake.
Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one
Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
kicked around. They will come out of this thing
with their flag high. And when they do, they are
entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that
are gloating over their present troubles. I hope
Canada is not one of those."
Stand proud, America!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is one of the best editorials that I have
ever read regarding the United States. It is nice
that one man realizes it. I only wish that the
rest of the world would realize it. We are always
blamed for everything, and never even get a thank
you for the things we do.
I would hope that each of you would send this to
as many people as you can and emphasize that they
should send it to as many of their friends until
this letter is sent to every person on the web. I
am just a single American that has read this, I
SURE HOPE THAT A LOT MORE READ IT SOON.

who

Since

Enron fame and fortune. He's Dan's old buddy.
Robin might be interested in the CMS job. Is she still working estate

very

HEADER_CONTENT I told Robin about it and gave her Curt's name and number. I don't know
if
she is following up with it or not. She's on the estate team with me.
She
had back surgery 3 or 4 weeks ago. She was riding in the car one day and
her leg just went numb. She went to a couple of specialist and they both
said she needed surgery right away. She had a herniated disc?disk in her
back. Sorta like what I had but my leg never went numb, hurt like crazy
but no numbness. She just started working half days this week.
Ingrid is doing pretty good. No problems so far! Our due date is May
7th.
MAN IS SHE HANGING OUT THERE TOO!!!! We moved in together late February
and that seems to be going well. She didn't want to know the sex so we
are
not sure if its male or female. I think little girls are adorable but I'm
smart enough to realize that all females are a pain in the rear end. And
my child's mother is no exception. She wants her last name to be the
baby's middle name. It doesn't sound good but what the heck. I think we
are going with Audrey Immer or Christopher Immer. I always wanted to be a
Christopher but I'm just a plain ol' Chris.
Ed McMichael keeps saying we don't have enough people to do what needs to
be done. He hired Chris Figarow?, worked for Fred Lagrasta or Craig, back
on contract. I don't know how you feel about that but it might be
something to consider. His number is 713-853-7657.

way, my sister was a Judy, not Judith--my dad was responsible for that one.

Have you called Scott H. about the CMS job? He might be a good match. When
I last emailed with him, he said he was going to take some time off once he
was done at EnergyUSA.

As for working estate team, I don't think I could go back now. Who knows
what horrible things I might say to Scott Neal?? He lied to me and was so
incredibly spineless when he told me I "wasn't part of the team" back in
December that I don't think I could stomach interacting with him on any
level.. You're on a different floor from them, right? You probably still
see some of the UBS people though. How is Judy? I haven't heard from her
in a long time. I emailed her a funny joke a while back but never heard
anything else from her.

Well, gotta go. Take care and say hello to Ingrid for me.

I got your email address from Scott Goodell. I hope things are
going
well
for you and I don't know if you are working or staying at home so
this
may
be a non event.
CMS Energy is trying to develop a presence in the North East. A
headhunter
set me up with an interview at CMS last Friday. I spoke with Curt
Lizzi,
Vice President of Wholesale Gas Trading. I don't know why he
agreed to
see
me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was
looking
for. He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience.
He
said
he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year. You
just
never
know. His number is 713-230-7205.
Let me know how things are going. ME?? just focused on living in
sin
with
a pregnant girlfriend.

HEADER_CONTENT Hi, Chris! It's good to hear from you.
Thanks for thinking about me. I saw CMS's ad in Sunday's paper
for
that
position. I sent my resume to them in response to an ad back in
December,
and their HR folks called me in early January about an interview.
Then
the
situation must have changed because then the HR lady acted like
they
didn't
really have a position to fill after all. I've discovered that
most HR
people are really lame (that's the nicest thing I can say!). I'll
call
Curt
Lizzi; however, I think you're more qualified to trade NE physical
than
I
am. I'm probably better suited for Gulf Coast.
I've been talking with Reliant and they may have a Gulf Coast
position
available soon. I'm not thrilled about some of the people there,
but
who
knows? Duke may have a Gulf Coast position available because
someone
recently quit; however, Renato works there now so I'm SOL. I had
a
good
interview with them in late January when they didn't have the
spot.
Since
then, Renato has started with them in their origination group.
Timing
is
everything!! Guess who Renato's working for? Eric Gonzales,
formerly
of
Enron fame and fortune. He's Dan's old buddy.
Robin might be interested in the CMS job. Is she still working
estate
team
at Enron/UBS?? I haven't spoken with her since December. I've
had
very
little contact with anyone there. My last emails went unanswered,
so I
decided to give up.
Good luck with your baby! When is the due date? I know you are
both
excited. It will be a real change in lifestyle but not a negative
one,
believe me.
Take care,
Susan
REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I told Robin about it and gave her Curt's name and number. I don't
know
if
she is following up with it or not. She's on the estate team with
me.
She
had back surgery 3 or 4 weeks ago. She was riding in the car one day
and
her leg just went numb. She went to a couple of specialist and they
both
said she needed surgery right away. She had a herniated disc?disk in
her
back. Sorta like what I had but my leg never went numb, hurt like
crazy
but no numbness. She just started working half days this week.
Ingrid is doing pretty good. No problems so far! Our due date is
May
7th.
MAN IS SHE HANGING OUT THERE TOO!!!! We moved in together late
February
and that seems to be going well. She didn't want to know the sex so
we
are
not sure if its male or female. I think little girls are adorable
but
I'm
smart enough to realize that all females are a pain in the rear end.
And
my child's mother is no exception. She wants her last name to be the
baby's middle name. It doesn't sound good but what the heck. I
think
we
are going with Audrey Immer or Christopher Immer. I always wanted to
be a
Christopher but I'm just a plain ol' Chris.
Ed McMichael keeps saying we don't have enough people to do what
needs
to
be done. He hired Chris Figarow?, worked for Fred Lagrasta or Craig,
back
on contract. I don't know how you feel about that but it might be
something to consider. His number is 713-853-7657.
Take care and keep in touch. I'll keep you posted if I hear
anything.
Chances are that you will hear about it before me though.

old
building next week. Its been "we are going to move next week" for 5 weeks
now but I think we are really going to do it this time. Kathy Kelly is on
the estate team with me and she might work with UBS because she updates
the
curves.
These are the estate team folks left under Ed McMiachael, me, Kathy Kelly,
Louis Dicarlo, Mide Bridges, Ruth Concannon, Maria Garza, Robin Barbe,
Troy
Denetsosie, Paul Gregory, Phil Polsky, Chris Figueroa, Yuan Tian, Victoria
Versen, Susan Scott... I think thats it. Eric Boyt left last week, he's
off to Midland working with some other guys in a new business, buying and
selling royalties and securing leases?? I think. Joe Parks left last
week
too.
Bob Hall announced that he was quitting last week as well. He's just
going
to stay at home for awhile. His oldest daughter is about to start college
and she's a national merit scholar. He said that really helps with the

E23290.1 (states "Retrofit - Oracle #52730.IB, 15419.02") 1/8/98

This LOOKS (at least as far as I can tell) like the volumes are a result of the Fuel Load need to support X HP hours for the compressor, this is echoed by a memo related to E23290 (looks like someone did an inquiry into this in 10/1995. I did a very quick scan of these "agreements" & it appears as all this looks to be gas for the "Hubbard Station" compressor fuel requirements (there is an Exhibit C that calcs out HP-hours into fuel requirements). Other than the SWAP confirms - - - - and this "agreement" I could not find anything else other than deal tkts.

The "Agreement" progression (for the Compression Services Agreement) goes like this:
3/1/95 Compression Services Agreement (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - Amended & Restated 11-1-97 (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - terminated & replaced by 6-29-00 Compression Services Agreement (Fuel Calc in Exhibit B).
The Fuel needs are found in the exhibits.

So, id according to the notes in TAGG & if all of these roll back to E23290 - - - - - here is your paperwork

i am part of the liquidation pool, but do not feel comfortable at all that they are really going to pay me. you know, if we sell $3 B you get xxx. but there is no way we are going to sell exactly $3B. and you have NO IDEA what you get if they sell $2 B or $3.5B.... and there is way too much loosiness involved in all of this, no letter stating anything, plus no trust on my part, that i don't think they will come thru. and of course, now you have the SEC thing going on. grrrr.

I am just checking to see whether you sent me your conclusions regarding
whether ENA should terminate the pooling agreement with Dominion. Do we
still need to speak with Iris? And, can we set up a meeting with Ed
McMichael so that we can make a decision and move forward? Please call
(5-3910) or email me.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01. From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01. That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market. However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.

Questions that need to be answered,
** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?



The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group. In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

HEADER_CONTENT Margaret
I've attached the prepayment request. The physical address for the bank is

Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
C/O Bank Of America
File #96264
840 S. Canal Street, 6th Floor
Chicago, IL 60693

The address of the company we are doing business is

Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
Nine Greenway Plaza
Houston, TX 77046

The person I negotiated the deal with is Andy Armstrong, his number is 832-676-5120.
The person at El Paso Corporate Credit (Tennessee is a sub of El Paso) is Julie Baker, her number is 713-420-7446.


Eric, Julie at El Paso said the only reason she is requiring a prepay for this small an amount is because her records show that ENA has not paid any monies for anything on the El Paso pipelines, including Tennessee, Sonat, ANR, or El Paso Pipeline. I know that we should have at least paid for the Bear Creek storage on Tennessee.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Same as before. We should have another supplier set up by the end of the day. The calculation for the prepay is 2000 dth x $.1221 per dth = $244.20 for gas flow on 2/5/02 on Tenn contract 2891.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.  Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will

1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada. Are there any special tax issues to address?

REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments? I hope we still have someone who can do that.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc

prepay Dominion for the supply each month.
This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at

was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying
any gas effective April 1, 2002. Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson
Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.
Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken
with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in
the past. He will fax a letter to me.
Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

deal on Florida





I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.

I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00.
This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000).

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure. There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out. I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco. Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169). I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day. Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.

Transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the East. They assign the shipper a specific meter for that pool and you use your IT contract to nominate pool to pool stuff.

I work with Richard in the Chicago office. I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston. Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC.

With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.

HEADER_CONTENT Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys. Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months. In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system. We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system. BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies. Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion? Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

HEADER_KEYWORDS ena sonat dth gas parked
HEADER_SUBJECT Sonat Park & Loan
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat. This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract. Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it. I need to know;

1. What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2. What period do I sell the gas for? All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline? Or base load in April? I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3. How many bids do I need to get? I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4. This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas. I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.



2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,  SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM. Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal. Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled. Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID. Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it. She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination. I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Thanks for the information. Sell, Sell, Sell! Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination. Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting. Here are some items to consider,

1. Park balance on deal #1222 188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
2. Loan balance on deal #1424 (96,000) dth
3. ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
4. ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002. We have Dec 2001. Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please? Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002? I would be very surprised if they did.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Useful math...
Ever wonder about those people who say they are
giving more than 100%?
We have all been to those meetings where someone
wants over 100%. How about
achieving 103%?
Here's a little math that might prove helpful.
What makes life 100%?
If the letters: "A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R
S T U V W X Y Z"
are represented as the numbers: "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26"
Then...
H A R D W O R K
8 1 18 4 23 15 18 11 = 98%
K N O W L E D G E
11 14 15 23 12 5 4 7 5 = 96%
But...
A T T I T U D E
1 20 20 9 20 21 4 5 = 100%
And...
B U L L S H I T
2 21 12 12 19 8 9 20 = 103%
So, it stands to reason that hard work and knowledge
will get you close,
attitude will get you there, but bullshit will put
you over the top.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT We (EES) have been getting December production payments ready -- what are your thoughts on actually paying the post-petition pieces?  Besides Dominion, we have producers off of Gatherco, Columbia Natural Resources,  Columbia Gas Transmission, Peoples Natural Gas, and East Ohio Gas.  Are these on your list to review some day like you are doing Dominion?   A few producers have called wanting to know when to expect payment and I just need to know whether to forge ahead to get caught up in getting their payments in the system, or to wait in case we have the producers taken out of our pools on all these pipes/ldc's.  It is a ton of work, and if it doesn't need to happen, all the better, but if it does need to happen, I need to be working on it now.
Also, only one company listed above could provide daily actuals so the others are just being split by 31 days.  I figured if the producer disputed his split (if paid), he could provide the back-up to make it more accurate.

Any comments will be helpful. Thanks.

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow. I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far. Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this. But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should. I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need. I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this? Let me know. If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify? I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy. Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee. Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

HEADER_KEYWORDS ena dth sonat gas 2002
HEADER_SUBJECT Sonat Park & Loan
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat. This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract. Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it. I need to know;

1. What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2. What period do I sell the gas for? All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline? Or base load in April? I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3. How many bids do I need to get? I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4. This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas. I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.



2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,  SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM. Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal. Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled. Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID. Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it. She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination. I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

HEADER_CONTENT Thanks for the information. Sell, Sell, Sell!

REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting. Here are some items to consider,

1. Park balance on deal #1222 188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
2. Loan balance on deal #1424 (96,000) dth
3. ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
4. ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002. We have Dec 2001. Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please? Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002? I would be very surprised if they did.

We were charged a total of $19,043.73 for the remaining volumes in storage ($.00305 per day). Please let me know if there is anything else that I need to do.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.  Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.
Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will
1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.
Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada. Are there any special tax issues to address?

HEADER_CONTENT Do you know the answer to the tax question, or at least who to ask?
FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments? I hope we still have someone who can do that.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

The way I have interpreted these e-mails, we should be withdrawing a total of 310,000 from dawn storage, right now deal1199439 is set up to deliver 327,081. I can adjust the back end days to reduce our deliveries down to 310,000, just want to be sure this is our target #.

Dynegy Is Mulling $2 Billion Investment In Enron in Possible Step Toward Merger
By ROBIN SIDEL
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
Dynegy Inc. is in advanced discussions to infuse about $2 billion into Enron Corp. in a transaction that may lead to a full-blown merger between the two companies, people familiar with the matter said.
A formal transaction could be unveiled as early as Thursday, these people said. The situation is very fluid and is subject to change, these people noted.
Enron has been rocked by last month's disclosure of a $1.2 billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by Enron's former chief financial officer. Last month, it reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter. Last week, Enron secured $1 billion in new credit lines, using gas-pipeline assets as collateral.
Enron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to raise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expected. Mostly, though, it needs to restore its credibility with Wall Street at a time when its access to the financing markets is drying up.
Enron, Houston, declined to comment. Dynegy couldn't be reached for comment.
News of the Dynegy discussions was first reported on CNBC.

HEADER_KEYWORDS sigh woman loud word fine
HEADER_SUBJECT  
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Words Women Use...

FINE ~ This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we
are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to describe how a
woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.

FIVE MINUTES ~ This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes
that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so
I
feel that it's an even trade.

NOTHING ~ If you ask her what is wrong and she says NOTHING, this means
something and you should be on your toes. NOTHING is usually used to
describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside
down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last
FIVE MINUTES and end with the word FINE.

GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows) ~ This is a dare. One that will result in a
woman getting upset over NOTHING and will end with the word FINE.
GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows) ~ This means "I give up" or "do what you want
because I don't care." You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead" in just a
few minutes, followed by NOTHING and FINE and she will talk to you in about
FIVE MINUTES when she cools off.

LOUD SIGH ~ This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal
statement very misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are
an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing
here and arguing with you over NOTHING.

SOFT SIGH ~ Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one
of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your
best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.

THAT'S OKAY ~ This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can
say to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard
before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you! have done.
"That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction
with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point in the near future when she
has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.

PLEASE DO ~ This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you
the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing
whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the
truth,
so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay."

THANKS ~ A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say "you're welcome."

THANKS A LOT ~ This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will say,
"Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you
have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."
Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as she will only
tell you "Nothing."

Please send this out to ! ALL men that you know just to warn them about
future
arguments they can avoid if remembering all the terminology.

And send to all your women friends to get a good laugh!

We are currently living together but we have no immediate plans to get

According to my girlfriends HR rep, her insurance will cover her for 12
weeks from the date the baby is born, after that she has to sign up for
COBRA.

These are my questions

When can I cover the baby under my insurance?

Will there be any problems moving the baby's coverage to her insurance
beginning 1/1/2003?

Can I cover my girlfriend under my insurance during her leave of absence
from Williams?

Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event. We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount. Following are my calculations






As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days. Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week. I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Okay, not sure who, if anyone, cares or needs to know BUT . . . .

Stingray Pipeline Company (34271) has been changed to Stingray Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (200104). This change created a new Global Counterparty number so it prompted manual changes to the Pipeline Name & Pipeline Counterparty data within Global Facilities. It also prompted the need to move (via assignment within Global Contracts) all service related agreements from the old GCP record to the new GCP record. I left both names on the Global Record, BUT due to system controls can only have 1 listed with the role of "Pipeline". This role was assigned to the "new" name & the old name (which is now a suspended GCP record) was made "Alternate Payee". This was a "guess" role - - - - and I have no idea of how the service side is impacted or at what level it validates the Global record attached to the deal. All contract services are the same on each record, but the role of "Pipeline" now resides with the new GCP.

Can you either let all those who need to know - - - know & let me know who/how should I share information like this in the future. You got a Transportation Greenie (just 'learned' how to change pipeline names today) over here.

Thanks so much!!

In an effort to better accommodate the needs of our PL-1 customers we have

that were posted on DTI's EBB with regard to this issue. The
implementation of this restriction on Friday at 10:00 a.m. ECT (9:00 CCT),
means that there will be no interruptible transportation capacity or
non-PL1 transportation capacity available along the PL-1 system. This
restriction will also require that all deliveries at that time on the PL-1
system be made to their primary delivery point. All interruptible and
secondary deliveries along the PL-1 system will be reduced to zero
effective for the gas day of June 14, 2002, at 10:00 ECT (9:00 CCT).

HEADER_CONTENT According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below. We have 3 options on serving this deal:
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1. Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost. However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below. For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou. The total transport cost is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month). We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price and the transport expense?

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or

We don't really know much about the New Company right now. I'm actually on the estate team anyway. I sit on 5 with Ruth Concannon, Sylvia Pollen, Robin Barbe, and Kathy Kelly. The rumor 2 weeks ago was that UBS was going to cut 25% of the jobs if they won. I think Victor said that we should know alot more by tomorrow.

HEADER_KEYWORDS dth gas sonat ena parked
HEADER_SUBJECT Sonat Park & Loan
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat. This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract. Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it. I need to know;

1. What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2. What period do I sell the gas for? All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline? Or base load in April? I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3. How many bids do I need to get? I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4. This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas. I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.



2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,  SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM. Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal. Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled. Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID. Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it. She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination. I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Thanks for the information. Sell, Sell, Sell! Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination. Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.

I found a payment from Duke Energy Field Services to settle storage fees due post bankruptcy dated 3/229/02. These funds are on SAP 3000006586 in the amount of $2,735,550.05 - short from the invoice of $416,000.00

I have screen prints on each and will bring them to you and turn over to the appropriate party.

HEADER_SUBJECT TGT -- November 2001  K#T018176
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I spoke again this morning to Pamela Brumbaugh at Texas Gas Transmission about contract #T018176.    This contract was acquired by capacity release from SIGCORP ENERGY.  Since ENA failed to pay the bill for November 2001 production,  then TGT's tariff allows them to go back to the original contract party -- SIGCORP ENERGY to get payment.  So TGT reversed the demand charges on our invoice and in turn sent an invoice to SIGCORP for this November 2001 production demand payment.  Thus it would appear that eventually ENA would have to make payment to SIGCORP Energy,  but as this winds thru the bankruptcy proceedings, this issue will need to get clarified.

Chris Spears -- please put a copy of this email in your TGT files.

HEADER_KEYWORDS loud word sigh woman fine
HEADER_SUBJECT  
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Words Women Use...

FINE ~ This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we
are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to describe how a
woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.

FIVE MINUTES ~ This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes
that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so
I
feel that it's an even trade.

NOTHING ~ If you ask her what is wrong and she says NOTHING, this means
something and you should be on your toes. NOTHING is usually used to
describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside
down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last
FIVE MINUTES and end with the word FINE.

GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows) ~ This is a dare. One that will result in a
woman getting upset over NOTHING and will end with the word FINE.
GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows) ~ This means "I give up" or "do what you want
because I don't care." You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead" in just a
few minutes, followed by NOTHING and FINE and she will talk to you in about
FIVE MINUTES when she cools off.

LOUD SIGH ~ This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal
statement very misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are
an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing
here and arguing with you over NOTHING.

SOFT SIGH ~ Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one
of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your
best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.

THAT'S OKAY ~ This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can
say to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard
before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you! have done.
"That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction
with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point in the near future when she
has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.

PLEASE DO ~ This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you
the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing
whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the
truth,
so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay."

THANKS ~ A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say "you're welcome."

THANKS A LOT ~ This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will say,
"Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you
have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."
Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as she will only
tell you "Nothing."

Please send this out to ! ALL men that you know just to warn them about
future
arguments they can avoid if remembering all the terminology.

And send to all your women friends to get a good laugh!

Additionally, ChevTex has formally requested through Jayne that the accounting information be provided for their review. I agree with Mark Ellenberg's view that we should not provide this until we have agreement on the commercial deal. Jayne/Stephen, I would like to hear from you on this.

We need to huddle today to discuss our response to Randy's letter and keep the momentum alive. Given the LIP meetings this morning, can I suggest 3:00 this morning in ECN2829?

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.  Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will

1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada. Are there any special tax issues to address?

HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

HEADER_SUBJECT Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I've made a few changes. I've heard from Greg and OpCo is on-board.

One remaining question is whether we go in offering to pay demand charges for the total 2.5Bcf or only the 1.9+Bcf actually used during this period, given that the gas was trapped. The ratable amount is approximately $100k lower than the $575k in the letter. If for no other reason, from a negotiating perspective I believe we should go in with the lower number. Mark, do you have a view on this? If our legal analysis is clearly based on demand charges at the maximum volume, we probably should stay with the $575k.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Chip,

This e-mail confirms the info that we talked about this morning:

1) We found the old interruptible transport contract that is referenced in the firm storage agreement. It is a maximum rate transport contract that allows discounting of transport rates. I do not know what the maximum transport rate is for Bridgeline, but it is probably one rate for the entire pipeline. No active discounts were found in ENA's records. With the pipeline's cooperation, however, new discounts can be negotiated.
2) Under ENA's firm storage agreement, you must withdraw it from storage at the Storage Delivery/Redelivery Point which is defined as the interconnect between the storage field and Bridgeline Pipeline System. This means that some sort of transportation agreement on Bridgeline must be used if ENA does not sell the inventory in place.
3) Chris is making some preliminary calls to gauge the market interest for purchasing ENA's storage inventory. So far he has not received much positive feedback. As we discussed before, using an interruptible transport contract puts the shipper at risk that the gas will show up everyday and be available for sale to third parties. The price ENA receives from purchasers will most likely be discounted for this IT transport risk.

Good luck with the meeting,

to 10,000 dth per day) $70,000.00.
I have combined the $40,000 and $70,000 on my worksheet but I'm not
sure how my cash department will wire the funds. As of today, ENA has
not purchased any swing supply on Trunkline Reliant and I do not
anticipate very much activity on this deal.
Please let me know if anyone has questions.
Thanks
P.S. Jim, according to Tallahassee, on February 27th that they
requested 2,000 dth and they only received 1,550 dth. Would you have
someone in your shop verify that before I make an adjustment to the
worksheet please.
Thanks

REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my
system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it
AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days
after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have
forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry
about it.
REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Because you have a discount before and after makes little difference - some

For now anyway. Yeah, I've emptied my car of certain items because I didn't want to carry them around. Hey we need to discuss how to divy those up. I've always wanted them even though I don't use them. Dad gave me the single shot 12, but there is still the little one, the double (the prize possesion) and the new one that you wanted to use.

The apartment is still pretty empty. I didn't want to empty my boxes until we got Immer's stuff in there. I don't think she has that much either, living room furniture, bed, 2 bedroom night stands, armwour, kitchen talble, 1 stupid cat.....

I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule. AS (tariff sheet #205) and IPP
(tariff sheet #215) are separate rate schedules in the tariff. AS pools
are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a
specific geographical location on the pipeline. AS pool meters can be used
as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP
Pool meters are not.

HEADER_CONTENT Attached is a presentation from Dynegy that answers the question of " Will intra-day capacity recalls support reliability for the Provider of Last Resort in a deregulated market ?" Dynegy seems to be saying "no". KeySpan is the LDC that is suggesting that the POLR ( in their minds, KeySpan ) needs intra-day capacity recall rights to serve the market reliably. Another question comes from this as to our larger business. That is, Will intra-day capacity recall rights effect our business favorably or unfavorably as a whole ? Chris and Maureen, I am interested in you thoughts on this asap.
REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Frank, I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email.

As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, "the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great" . The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days. Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows. If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures. This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.


However, we do support intra-day capacity release.

Starting Monday, 4/22/02, manual wire requests will have to go through the Cash Management Committee (CMC) the day before payment. This means that the request forms and accompanying support documentation will have to be signed by the appropriate signatories of the business unit (BU), the BU CAO and the BU Head and delivered to myself (3-6337) at EBN 714a or Drew Kanellopoulos (3-9424) the day before the CMC meeting. For example, if you need a wire sent on Wednesday, 4/24/02, you would need to deliver the request to us by the end of the day on Monday, 4/22/02 so the request could be reviewed at the 4/23/02 CMC meeting. Check requests should be delivered three days in advance.

The only exceptions to this process will be items such as same day payment for prepay commodities.

We appreciate you helping us relieve the incredible stress on the system to get payments more efficiently and please pass this on to anyone I have missed.

Besides Dominion, we have producers off of Gatherco, Columbia Natural Resources, Columbia Gas Transmission, Peoples Natural Gas, and East Ohio Gas.  Are these on your list to review some day like you are doing Dominion?   A few producers have called wanting to know when to expect payment and I just need to know whether to forge ahead to get caught up in getting their payments in the system, or to wait in case we have the producers taken out of our pools on all these pipes/ldc's.  It is a ton of work, and if it doesn't need to happen, all the better, but if it does need to happen, I need to be working on it now.

Also, only one company listed above could provide daily actuals so the others are just being split by 31 days.  I figured if the producer disputed his split (if paid), he could provide the back-up to make it more accurate.

HEADER_KEYWORDS dth ena sonat gas parked
HEADER_SUBJECT Sonat Park & Loan
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat. This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract. Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it. I need to know;

1. What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2. What period do I sell the gas for? All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline? Or base load in April? I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3. How many bids do I need to get? I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4. This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas. I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.



2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,  SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM. Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal. Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled. Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID. Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it. She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination. I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination. Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.

REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting. Here are some items to consider,

1. Park balance on deal #1222 188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
2. Loan balance on deal #1424 (96,000) dth
3. ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
4. ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002. We have Dec 2001. Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please? Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002? I would be very surprised if they did.

HEADER_SUBJECT Bridgeline Invoicing
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify. In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms). Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties. Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691. This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer. The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00. Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice.

Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket? According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Nothing is paid to or agreed with Bridgeline until we reach resolution and get approval to proceed. Have we received these in past months? What have we done with those?

If it does not create a confirmation, what does it mean to approve this ticket?
REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT In the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system. Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and Enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.

Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA. I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket. I'll see what I can do.

This will increase our supply with Dominion which I believe you have been informed
by Dominion as well.
The Swing gas for 2/27/02 will be reduced by 450 to 1,550 due to an operational scheduling cut
from the Reliant pool. The City of Tallahassee has already deducted this from their payment on
the original invoice. In summary, I will be preparing an additional invoice to the City of Tallahassee

HEADER_CONTENT Hey team. I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it. Brenda Fletcher was asking me

Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.









When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this). Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space. I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel. Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).


Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in. Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3). As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price. I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.

Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal. That's around $1,340,000. I'm sure AEC is not expecting that. Does anyone here talk to AEC?

Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.
Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will
1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

I can adjust the back end days to reduce our deliveries down to 310,000, just want to be sure this is our target #.

HEADER_CONTENT Greetings,

Thanks for the TV. and Jaime also said Thanks for the bed room suite.
Chris, I found Dad's old pistol. It was under the dresser in his bed room.
I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left. It is
captured in a pistol storage case. I stuck it in behind the sheets and
things. I saw Chad and Angela on my way out. They are a great couple.
Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work. I am going
to get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if he
wants to lease Dad's pasture.
As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year. You had said we do not want to
pay for a fence along the creek. When I have leased places in the past I
have had to build new fence at my own expense. Most folk's base their
cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation. If I built fence
and that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,
then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,
excluding my labor. Something to think about. I hope we do not own that
place for five more years. Gerald also said he would mow the grass around
the house and sort of keep the place tuned up.

Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead. They placed her in
Angleton/Danbury for overnight observation. I think she required about
seven stitches in her head. There were x-rays taken and her lungs are
pretty much gone. Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech can
read his prints.

Stopped by and saw Bernie Max. Now where did they come up with a name like
that? They removed the lymph glands from his neck. Starting down the torso
just at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down the
torso about six or seven inches. A triangle shape about the size of a piece
of large pizza. The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep into
his body. The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue. They took a pretty
big chunk out of his chest. He had a six " x eight " piece of skin removed
from his left thing for a skin graft. It looked pretty painful. He was in
good spirits and bull corning around.

I guess that is about it. I would like to have a timber appraisal performed
on the Dad's place. I'll be chatting with you guys. Oh, I forgot the dang
remote to the TV. I really was not for sure which one it was. I think I
need it to program the darn thing. Keep your powder dry.

Y'all be safe,

HEADER_CONTENT Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.  Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will

1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada. Are there any special tax issues to address?

FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments? I hope we still have someone who can do that.

I had Phillip Love enter these prior to the bankruptcy. These are items we would have collected and then
repaid to other parties on behalf of the State of Florida. Since we were unable to do that, these charges need
to be removed. If you have any other questions, please call me.

Thanks,

P.S. I will be sending your pricing adjustments for December 2001 soon.

I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team. Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.

This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke. All the activity is for the Enovate deals. Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron. Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow. I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far. Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this. But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should. I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need. I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this? Let me know. If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify? I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy. Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee. Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I just spoke with Theresa Vos. She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers. Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU. There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity. It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too. We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at? I'd like to see that if possible.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.  Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will

1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada. Are there any special tax issues to address?

FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments? I hope we still have someone who can do that.

HEADER_CONTENT Chris / Shemin / Ruth,

Here's a brief recap of what happened on the Dominion issues from the EES side. I would like to get an idea of where we stand with them now and make sure I coordinate with the ENA counsel and ENA's position with Dominion. Basically I want to make sure we address our "frozen" storage and decide how best to resolve the local producers issue ( when to pay and from what date ).

Basically the chronology from the EES is as follows :

Prior to Dec 2001, EES had storage capacity and Dominion transport released to us from Niagara Mohawk ( NIMO) for our customers behind that LDC. Over the summer of 2001 we injected approx. 680,000 dthms which should be worth $2.4 MM now.
Upon declaration of bankruptcy NIMO terminated our ability to serve customers behind the LDC as a result of the NY PUC ruling.
Also upon bankruptcy Dominion Transmission terminated all our transportation contracts including the transport for the storage capacity we had from NIMO. Dominion then took the position that our gas was frozen and could be used as an offset against the amounts we owed them.
Marshall Turner and Melanie turner of Weil Gotshal have been in discussions with the counsel for Dominion, Bill Saviers ( Internal ) Paul Vrana and Bruce Ruzinsky of Jackson Walker ( external )
One of the issues in dispute is whether Dominion can offset the value of our storage gas against payables due from ENA. I don't know if this has been resolved.

TDC stated that it would "file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002. Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.

Kay, Ed, Question: I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court. Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC? Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

First, I would like to thank you for all that you have done so far while here at Enron. Although it has been difficult to continually hear one bad news story after another, it has been refreshing to finally learn the truth and be given the opportunity to make judgments and decisions based upon reality rather than some pipe dream that was being offered. I truly feel that with your leadership, Enron is heading in the right direction and is slowly making progress in building back credibility.

Second, as an employee in the LIP pool, I do however, have a couple of questions. It has now been over three weeks since we received an update from Robert Jones regarding reaching the first $500,000,000 milestone. In that update it was mentioned that there were some administrative issues that needed to be addressed with regards to the first distribution. Are we any closer to resolving those issues and do we have an estimated time for that first distribution? Second, do we have any idea today of how much money has overall been brought in to the estate that is to be used in determining the funding of the LIP pool?

Thank you so much for your time.

HEADER_CONTENT With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people. As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business. Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer. Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization. For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila. For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed. At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go.

No one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice. Please try to hold your head up, we have built a great company of talented, motivated, creative, and dedicated people.  Hold on to your integrity, respect yourself and each other, and remember what a team we have had.

HEADER_KEYWORDS producers dominion release letter gas
HEADER_SUBJECT Termination / Release letters for Producers on Dominion Transmission
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter.

Several gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool. They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers. Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them. I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests. Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships. Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below. I am sure more producers will call.

Thanks WRP

Hi team. Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO. As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working. So, this is what I need to know;

Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

I work with Richard in the Chicago office. I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston. Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC. The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled? With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.
FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys. Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months. In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system. We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system. BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies. Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion? Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.
Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will
1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

HEADER_CONTENT Here's what Beverly had to say.


Tell Chris hi for me too. And, congrats on the new baby! This reorg is
going to be very interesting. You are going to have scheduling people doing
contracts and accounting and vice versa. They haven't announced who is
working for who yet, but we are getting the operations accounting people and
their manager. Then, we are going from 4 teams to 3 big ones. We'll see.
Supposedly, the managers are dividing up the customers first under the
managers, then putting us wherever they want, I guess. It's kind of crazy
around here. Let me put it this way - if the industry didn't suck right
now, I'd look for a new job. This company is weird. It takes them forever
to do anything, then they don't have the right people in the right places.
Plus, they are very, let's say conservative, instead of 'cheap'. When you
are used to the best money can buy, like at Enron, then you go to a company
that complains if you throw away a paper clip, well, you get the picture?
No wonder it's taken them 5 years to get 1Line, which, by the way, still
doesn't work too well!!

I need to send out a payment of about $2.1 million next Tuesday to Reliant. The price is based off the NYMEX settle for today which we won't know until after 3:00 PM. And I prefer to wait until the day after NYMEX settles so I can see the price in a published document like Gas Daily. This puts us in a bit of a bind.

What I can do is prepare the cash request form today based off the NYMEX settle, that means you won't get it from me until after 3:30 PM. Monday morning I will verify the price in print, and get the signed wire request to you before 10:00 AM assuming Margaret, Ed, and Susan are all available to sign it. Phil already has an estimate for these amounts on the Gas Cash Forcast worksheet.

Let me know if this works for you.

If you send me an email this afternoon with the estimated amount (I assume it will be $2.1MM) and the net benefit/(cost) to the estate, I will add the amount to the summary for discussion with the Cash Committee on Monday.

Richard Hanagriff at Transwestern called and asked that we e-mail him our wiring instructions so that TW can pay ENA's capacity release revenue sharing for January 2002. The details of the deal and my discussions with TW are given below. Please send him the wiring instructions so that we can get the money in the door.

Please note that there will also be payments made to ENA under K#24924 for February and March 2002. The good news is that invoice credits will be very clear for Feruary and March, since the deals were done for the entire month.

Richard Hanagriff's phone number is 713-853-6709.

Thanks,

Ruth


CAPACITY RELEASE REVENUE SHARING TRANSACTION

ENA and Transwestern agreed to share the revenues generated in releasing ENA's TW capacity in excess of our discounted rates on a month-to-month basis. The agreement also requires that TW release us from claims if the capacity is released at rates below ENA's contract rates. As a result, only K# 24924 (i.e. the San Juan contract) has been released to a third party.

Transwestern was able to release the 25,000 Dth/d of Ignacio to I/B Link capacity at $0.065/Dth for January 11-31 (i.e. 21 days). Since our discounted rate is $0.06/Dth, ENA should receive 50% of $0.005/Dth, or $0.0025/Dth, for the 21 day period. Transwestern's invoice for January 2002 business showed that a $13,687.50 payment is due Transwestern. This amount was calculated from a credit of $0.0625/Dth for 21 days offsetting the $46,500 monthly charge. Another way to calculate this amount is that ENA's portion of the capacity release revenue sharing, $1,312.50, was netted against the $15,000.00 pipeline charges for January 1-10.

ENA's position is that the agreement entitled ENA to receive the revenue sharing of $1,312.50 as a cash payment during the normal billing cycle, and that the other $15,000 should be addressed during the bankruptcy claim process. I discussed this issue with Paul Y'Barbo at Transwestern on February 15th. He followed up with me on February 20th that ENA will be paid the $1,312.50 as soon as Transwestern receives payment from the outside party that picked up ENA's capacity. TW thought that payment from the third party would be received in a "couple of days".

Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas. Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00. I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.
EMAIL_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now. This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract. It is scheduled to come out on Sonat. To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges. But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal. I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.


We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat. I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.

SOURCE: Dynegy Inc.
Dynegy Promotes Matt Schatzman to President and CEO of Energy Convergence
Business
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 16, 2002--Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN - news)
today announced that Matt K. Schatzman, previously president of Energy
Trading, has been promoted to president and chief executive officer of the
company's energy convergence business. In this capacity, Schatzman will

operations and development of Dynegy's U.S. generation facilities, and
Dynegy Canada to his current responsibilities, which include all energy

to report to Dynegy Inc. President and Chief Operating Officer Steve
Bergstrom.
Schatzman joined Dynegy in 1990 as director of Transportation after
spending three years at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. He served in
positions of increasing responsibility in the gas marketing and trading

as executive vice president, Marketing and Origination, where his
responsibilities included oversight of all long-term marketing and
origination in gas and power throughout the United States as well as
oversight over Dynegy's retail operations.
Cliff Hare, formerly senior vice president of Marketing and Origination
for the Southeast, has been promoted and will replace Schatzman as
president of Energy Trading. After spending 10 years with Southern Natural
Gas Co., Hare joined Natural Gas Clearinghouse, Dynegy's predecessor
company, in 1987 and has served in various departments within the company,
including transportation, gas trading, power fuel and gas and power
marketing. He will relocate to Dynegy's Houston headquarters and will
report to Schatzman.

HEADER_SUBJECT Termination / Release letters for Producers on Dominion Transmission
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter.

Several gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool. They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers. Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them. I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests. Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships. Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below. I am sure more producers will call.

Thanks WRP

The following producers have been calling requested such letters:

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Mr. Cooper,

First, I would like to thank you for all that you have done so far while here at Enron. Although it has been difficult to continually hear one bad news story after another, it has been refreshing to finally learn the truth and be given the opportunity to make judgments and decisions based upon reality rather than some pipe dream that was being offered. I truly feel that with your leadership, Enron is heading in the right direction and is slowly making progress in building back credibility.

Second, as an employee in the LIP pool, I do however, have a couple of questions. It has now been over three weeks since we received an update from Robert Jones regarding reaching the first $500,000,000 milestone. In that update it was mentioned that there were some administrative issues that needed to be addressed with regards to the first distribution. Are we any closer to resolving those issues and do we have an estimated time for that first distribution? Second, do we have any idea today of how much money has overall been brought in to the estate that is to be used in determining the funding of the LIP pool?

Thank you so much for your time.

Kathy Kelly

P.S. We are greatly appreciative and happy about the reinstatement of the 401K matching. Thanks again!

I am just checking to see whether you sent me your conclusions regarding
whether ENA should terminate the pooling agreement with Dominion. Do we

McMichael so that we can make a decision and move forward? Please call

EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01. From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01. That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market. However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.

Questions that need to be answered,
** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?



The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group. In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002. Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier. Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions,
the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM. Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

Hi team. Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO. As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working. So, this is what I need to know;

Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

HEADER_CONTENT Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate.

I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team. Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team. Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months. I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728. This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke. All the activity is for the Enovate deals. Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron. Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access. Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?

HEADER_CONTENT I don't think the triggers are correct.

Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system. Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002? One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers. We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002. These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.
REPLY_END

HEADER_CONTENT Chris -Can we get these deals fixed (delete the triggers) so they can be reversed (corrected) in Unify? We have April-02 out on A/R all ready, but May-02 is still in draft status (we have not closed the accrual/accounting month change in Unify for ENA).

The sooner the better. Please let me know.

1. Does anyone have any idea on how to stop deals 340305 and 332163 from creating an invoice each month?

2. There are deal volumes in Sitara for the East, Central and West desk. Should these volumes be zeroed out or should we just focus on keeping tagg updated and not worry about Sitara? Maybe someone is working on the Sitara deal volumes.

SOURCE: Dynegy Inc.
Dynegy Promotes Matt Schatzman to President and CEO of Energy Convergence
Business
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 16, 2002--Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN - news)
today announced that Matt K. Schatzman, previously president of Energy
Trading, has been promoted to president and chief executive officer of the
company's energy convergence business. In this capacity, Schatzman will
add energy marketing and origination, commercial asset management,
operations and development of Dynegy's U.S. generation facilities, and
Dynegy Canada to his current responsibilities, which include all energy
transportation, logistics and risk management activities. He will continue
to report to Dynegy Inc. President and Chief Operating Officer Steve
Bergstrom.
Schatzman joined Dynegy in 1990 as director of Transportation after
spending three years at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. He served in
positions of increasing responsibility in the gas marketing and trading
fields and was promoted to vice president in 1992. In 1996, he was named

as executive vice president, Marketing and Origination, where his
responsibilities included oversight of all long-term marketing and
origination in gas and power throughout the United States as well as
oversight over Dynegy's retail operations.
Cliff Hare, formerly senior vice president of Marketing and Origination
for the Southeast, has been promoted and will replace Schatzman as
president of Energy Trading. After spending 10 years with Southern Natural
Gas Co., Hare joined Natural Gas Clearinghouse, Dynegy's predecessor
company, in 1987 and has served in various departments within the company,
including transportation, gas trading, power fuel and gas and power
marketing. He will relocate to Dynegy's Houston headquarters and will
report to Schatzman.

HEADER_SUBJECT Manual Wire/Check Requests
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Folks,

Starting Monday, 4/22/02, manual wire requests will have to go through the Cash Management Committee (CMC) the day before payment. This means that the request forms and accompanying support documentation will have to be signed by the appropriate signatories of the business unit (BU), the BU CAO and the BU Head and delivered to myself (3-6337) at EBN 714a or Drew Kanellopoulos (3-9424) the day before the CMC meeting. For example, if you need a wire sent on Wednesday, 4/24/02, you would need to deliver the request to us by the end of the day on Monday, 4/22/02 so the request could be reviewed at the 4/23/02 CMC meeting. Check requests should be delivered three days in advance.

The only exceptions to this process will be items such as same day payment for prepay commodities.

We appreciate you helping us relieve the incredible stress on the system to get payments more efficiently and please pass this on to anyone I have missed.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I decided to wait until tomorrow to do the prepay to go out Monday.

Margaret, for some reason my cash request form has Susan Helton's name on it and she has to sigh the wire I think. Why wouldn't that be you instead?

HEADER_KEYWORDS eastern transco capacty lilco contract
HEADER_SUBJECT Transportation notes for Feb
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure. There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out. I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco. Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169). I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day. Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes. I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails. Who should I include from scheduling?
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT chrissy,
what is the lilco deal you are referring to? are we currently noming this? can't find anything in unify that shows that we are.

what deal on transco would you need an it contract for?

also, did you go and change the capacty ticket to reflect the release of capacty? I'm not sure how to reflect it, but the ticket numbers
are 1190900, and 1190720. I can do this for you if you tell me how it should be reflected.

later gator

REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Guess what. I have the deal numbers in my notebook packed in a box - but Ed McMichael said we are not going to flow this gas until March. I think he also said he is trying to resurrect the Con Ed deal - which is probably similar to the Lilco deal with respect to the pipelines it flows on.

Transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the East. They assign the shipper a specific meter for that pool and you use your IT contract to nominate pool to pool stuff.

I DID NOT CHANGE THAT OL CAPACITY TICKET BUT I THINK I WILL. I'VE GOT TIME!!!!!!!!!

colors green blue yello purple red black white orange
You are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard.
You are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'. In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'. It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure.
Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being.
You are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'.
You need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them.
Don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy. Just remember, no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them.

from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001
(sitara deal #1143983). TDC stated that it would "file a claim for
administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all
other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the
close of business Feb 22, 2002. Based on the information in this email it
appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.
Kay, Ed, Question: I have not contacted TDC to determine if they
have filed a claim with the court. Would that have any impact on making a
payment to TDC? Should I contact TDC?
Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630 Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time. TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00. I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update. Please let me know what I can tell
him. This was an ENA deal.

ENA purchased gas from TDC (sitara #1143983) in the month of December 2001 on NGPL. It appears that we scheduled the gas on an NGPL IT agreement to the NGPL LA Pool. At the pool, it appears that we made some sales
Deal 1184526 Cornerstone Propane, L.P.
Deal 1184587 MidAmerican Energy Company
Deals 258085 and 315861 to Enron MW, L.L.C. - desk to desk deals.

Did Cornersone pay ENA for the gas?
Did MidAmerican pay ENA for the gas?
How do these desk to desk deals work?
Did any of this goes go to cash out or did ENA go short and cash out?

Not a rush but I would like to have an answer by next Friday if possible.

Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will

1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada. Are there any special tax issues to address?

FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments? I hope we still have someone who can do that.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

HEADER_SUBJECT Transportation notes for Feb
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure. There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out. I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco. Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169). I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day. Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes. I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails. Who should I include from scheduling?
EMAIL_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT These are my notes on flowing gas. Tetco will be the problem pipeline. I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it. I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00. I'm using the following formula

MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price

They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem. It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up. I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals. If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.

Who knows what volumes are going to be?
FORWARD_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Tennessee requires a pepayment or LC in the amount of $25,000.00 per SA pool. For the Keyspan deal, that essentially means we would need $25,000.00 of credit for each point, 500L, 800L, and Zone 0 = $75,000.00 total.

Subject:   RE: Dominion gas supply Tallahassee
deal on Florida





I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

HEADER_SUBJECT WCG bankruptcy -- disappointing, but very little effect on
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Williams

Dear fellow Williams employees:
One day shy of a year ago, Williams successfully completed the spinoff of
Williams Communications. It was a long and challenging process with one
very important goal: To create two healthy companies better positioned to
grow.
We've learned this evening that WCG has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Although filing for bankruptcy is far from the beginning of an end, this
is disappointing * as we all hoped for WCG to succeed financially on its
own. The implosion of the entire telecom industry has made that financial
success elusive, at least in the near term, for WCG and others.
So, what exactly does WCG's bankruptcy mean to Williams? And more
importantly, what does it mean to you? WCG's bankruptcy will have very
little effect on our company. Actually, I see it as a "non-event" with
respect to Williams, and so should you. We have anticipated this event and
worked diligently to minimize the impact.
As I previously communicated to you, we have already constructively dealt
with the two major contingent liabilities related to Williams
Communications. In other words, we've already written down the receivable
from WCG to approximately 20 cents on the dollar related to the
obligations referenced above. We are assessing whether additional non-cash
write-downs will be necessary based on our evaluation of WCG's current
prospects and the details of today's filing.
Currently, the recorded carrying value of these WCG obligations to
Williams is approximately $455 million (written down from $2.3 billion).
Additionally, WCG has an obligation to Williams for the lease of its
headquarters building and certain other assets such as airplanes,
furniture and fixtures. Williams' current carrying amount of this
receivable is $154 million.
Since most of us are WCG shareholders, I realize you have a personal
interest in this turn of events. If you own stock in WCG, you need to
speak to WCG and/or your financial adviser with respect to what actions
you should take with the stock.
We continue to wish the best for WCG and its employees as the company
strives to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy. Its business is an
important part of our history and many of the people are former co-workers
from whom we learned a great deal. Your focus, however, should remain on
Williams and our bright future ahead.

I am just checking to see whether you sent me your conclusions regarding
whether ENA should terminate the pooling agreement with Dominion. Do we
still need to speak with Iris? And, can we set up a meeting with Ed
McMichael so that we can make a decision and move forward? Please call
(5-3910) or email me.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01. From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01. That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market. However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.

Questions that need to be answered,
** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?



The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group. In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM. Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

The only positive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay. ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million.

Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers, informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas.

Margaret, it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise to keep working on it until 1) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA or 2) I've run out of customers to call.

I checked our tariff and with our in house council and there is nothing that
precludes us from assisting you with marketing this capacity. In fact, our
tariff provides for it in Section 28.15 of the General Terms & Conditions
(Transporter & Shipper negotiate a "marketing fee" for Transporter to
actively market capacity on behalf of Shipper). So as not to set a
precedent of doing it for free, I've attached a letter agreement for a token
$1 marketing fee. What is the protocol (and likelihood) of having something
like this signed?

Once the capacity is offered and a replacement shipper is found, all three
parties would sign a permanent release agreement, a pro forma of which is
also attached. Basically it outlines who the parties are, what agreements
are in place, and takes all the liability (and right of first refusal) off
of you and puts it on the Replacement Shipper. Enron has signed a similar
agreement in the past regarding the majority of volumes on the same contract
when it released them to ProGas in 1997.

Please call me to discuss and/or if you need the relevant tariff page faxed
to you.

For example, if you need a wire sent on Wednesday, 4/24/02, you would need to deliver the request to us by the end of the day on Monday, 4/22/02 so the request could be reviewed at the 4/23/02 CMC meeting.

HEADER_SUBJECT Transportation notes for Feb
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure. There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out. I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco. Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169). I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day. Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes. I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails. Who should I include from scheduling?
EMAIL_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT These are my notes on flowing gas. Tetco will be the problem pipeline. I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it. I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00. I'm using the following formula

MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price

They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem. It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up. I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals. If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.

Who knows what volumes are going to be?

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas. Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00. I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.
EMAIL_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now. This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract. It is scheduled to come out on Sonat. To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges. But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal. I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.


We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat. I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.

Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day


Computer Gender

An English teacher was explaining to the students
the
concept of gender
association in the English language; noting how
hurricanes at one time were
given only female names, and how ships and planes
were
usually referred to
as "she." One of the students raised her hand and
asked,
"What gender is a
computer?"

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class
into two
groups: males
in one, females in the other, and asked them to
decide if
a computer should
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked
to give
four reasons for
their recommendations.

The group of women concluded that computers
should be
referred to as
masculine because:

1. In order to get their attention, you have to
turn them
on.

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.

3. They are supposed to help you solve your
problems, but
half the time,
they ARE the problem.

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that,
if you
had waited a
little longer, you could have had a better model.

The men, on the other hand, decided that
computers
should definitely be
referred to as feminine because:

1. No one but their creator understands their
internal
logic.

2. The native language they use to communicate
with other
computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else.

3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in
long-term
memory for later
retrieval.

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you
find
yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.

Actually it is not a new truck. Had 33,000 miles, Ram 2500 3/4 ton, 4 x 4,
360 Magnum Motor. Infinity stereo, bucket seats, nerf bars, tool box, bed
liner, camper tow package, 5 speed manual. Oh, it is dueled out through one
catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound. Makes me want to
race!!! I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well. Now,
Debbie wants it. I gave $16,900 + tax. It is very clean and is Sandalwood,
Driftwood or something of that nature in color. Almost silver. I have to
pick up old gray over at Jerry's. Debbie said, it is going to be hard on me
to sale my old dodge truck. I said Yep, had that truck longer than I have
had most of my women. I really need to engage brain before articulating! I
am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before
rain. One thing is for sure, the economy is not faltering on my account.
Dow Stock is back up over $33. Hooray, hoorah!
Needs to go to $41 and then I will be happy. I spoke with Gerald and he
said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad's place. We need to
change the lock and place posted signs at the gate. I may want to put some
steers or heifers up there. I am going up soon and having the tractor
fixed. Reggie said he will pay us soon. He also still wants the tractor if

out on the balcony tonight and gaze at the full moon. It was sure beautiful
coming up last night. We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket
and watch for the space shuttle. I had a couple of hickies on my neck the
day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns. Just
jealous.

My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate
within the four year period. She still has some sort of scholarship but I
am not for sure how much it pays. She is going to be a kinesiologist,
sports injury therapist. I think she just wants to be able to touch
football players legs. She will be 20 on 11/03. I am really proud of her.
Cindy said Jaime has grown up very much.
You should e mail her sometimes. I am sure she would like to hear from you.

At any rate, be careful and be safe. You should have listened to Maw, as

HEADER_SUBJECT Capacity Release
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. has an existing capacity release to Enron North
America for 30,000 Dth per day. This release of Columbia Gulf FTS-1
capacity has a term expiring on March 31, 2002.

It is our understanding that Enron has not paid Columbia Gulf the November
2001 payment or the December 2001 payment. Since Enron has defaulted on its
post petition payment and Columbia Gas of Ohio is ultimately responsible
for payment to Columbia Gulf, pursuant to the Columbia Gulf tariff,
Columbia Gas of Ohio has the right to recall the capacity upon 24 hours
notice.

Columbia Gas of Ohio hereby gives notice to Enron that unless payment is
made to Columbia Gulf by 5:00 pm on Friday, February 1, 2002 by wire
transfer, Columbia Gas of Ohio will recall the capacity effective Tuesday,
February 5, 2002.

If you would like to discuss this matter, please give me a call at
telephone number 614-460-4996.

HEADER_CONTENT Donna,

I mentioned this to Bob on yesterday and he said to forward this to you. We have not made any payments since we filed bankruptcy for pre or post petition activity at the direction of management. When I spoke with the guy on yesterday, we agreed exactly on one of the invoices for around $80K, but he was supposed to get me the other contract number and amount since there are supposedly two outstanding invoices. Please let me know how we need to handle this.
REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT As far as I know, ENA is not using any transport on Columbia Gas or Gulf. If NiSource wants to recall, I do not believe it will create a problem.
Kim Olinger is coordinating all the Logistics activities for the wholesale desk.  (Kim...would you please confirm....).

It's important to note, that if ENA wants to keep this capacity, they must pay in full the outstanding indebtedness, together with accrued interest at the Commission approved interest rate, and furnish adequate assurance of payment to Releasor if required by the Releasor w/n 24 hours of being notified.
Since this message was not received from Nisource until 3:08 p.m. 1/31/02........ officially, Nisource can not recall the capacity until the evening cycle of 2/1/02.

I do want you to know that EES is actively nominating on Columbia Gas Transmission to the Columbia Gas of Ohio and PA markets. If we receive any notice
of capacity recall on EES capacity, we will want to react and it will be critical to communicate this notification to me ASAP.

Thanks Rita!!

HEADER_SUBJECT Termination / Release letters for Producers on Dominion Transmission
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter.

Several gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool. They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers. Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them. I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests. Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships. Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below. I am sure more producers will call.

Thanks WRP

HEADER_SUBJECT Sonat Park & Loan
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat. This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract. Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it. I need to know;

1. What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2. What period do I sell the gas for? All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline? Or base load in April? I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3. How many bids do I need to get? I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4. This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas. I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.



2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,  SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM. Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal. Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled. Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID. Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it. She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination. I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

HEADER_CONTENT Thanks for the information. Sell, Sell, Sell! Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination. Try to get other bids to validate as best you can. Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

HEADER_CONTENT Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting. Here are some items to consider,

1. Park balance on deal #1222 188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
2. Loan balance on deal #1424 (96,000) dth
3. ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
4. ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002. We have Dec 2001. Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please? Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002? I would be very surprised if they did.

Kay, we will not wire any funds to Reliant until we have your approval of the contract. I understand that you are also working on a gas contract with TXU. We need one of these contracts in place so we can buy gas tomorrow morning, it doesn't matter which contract we have in place first.

Doug, Phil, Eric,
The prepayment that we were going to send to Reliant may be going to TXU instead. We are coming dangerously close to defaulting on the Tallahassee contract. Robin and I are going to work on a prepayment request for TXU after lunch.

HEADER_CONTENT Summary: TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00
from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001
(sitara deal #1143983). TDC stated that it would "file a claim for
administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all
other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the
close of business Feb 22, 2002. Based on the information in this email it
appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.
Kay, Ed, Question: I have not contacted TDC to determine if they
have filed a claim with the court. Would that have any impact on making a
payment to TDC? Should I contact TDC?
Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00
REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT If is was an ENA deal, the Dec. 3 is correct post-petition date.
I don't have anything on my list from TDC. Won't hurt to call them
anyway.
REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment. The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted. If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms may be mild such as numbness in the limbs or severe -- paralysis or loss of vision.
Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are giving hope to those affected by the disease.
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is dedicated to ending the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.

HEADER_SUBJECT Results of the Bankruptcy Hearing for TCO's  Issues With EES
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Here is a quick update on how the Columbia Gas Transmission,TCO, bankruptcy hearing went last week for the EES issues:

TCO agreed to withdraw the portion of their motion that was associated with EES. The pipeline admitted that EES has been using their transport contracts and have been paying their bills since the bankruptcy petition date.
The $2.1 million claim that TCO had been including in the Enron "set off amount" (i.e. the remaining demand charges for EES's agreements until the end of the contract terms) was pulled out TCO's Motion.
The minimum OBA/pooling agreement monthly balance should no longer be required by the pipeline (Note: Originally TCO appeared to be using EES's minimum balance to set off ENA & EES obligations).

I would recommend that you challenge TCO's operations folks, if they continue to say that EES must be keeping a minimum balance in your OBA. If you have any problems, please let me know and I will get our outside counsel involved again.

I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB). If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me. If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Tennessee Gas Pipeline has made a global Enron bankruptcy filing. We have checked the information that EES provided earlier to Maria and there was no retail contracts on Tennessee Gas Pipeline shown. Tennessee shows the following six active contracts with Enron Energy Services, Inc. Please provide some additional clarification including the following information so that Enron can decide how to best respond to the filing.

CONTRACTS

Balancing Agreement K# 31905 (OBAD)
Firm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38535 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38539 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT)
Supply Aggregation Servic [Germany, Chris]  e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)


INFORMATION REQUIRED

Is the contract active or how/when did EES dispose of it?
Did EES nominate under the agreements since November 30, 2001? If so, provide nomination by day.
Does EES need to retain the contract?
How much pre-petition and post-petition claims are due to Tennessee?
Are there any contract imbalances remaining that need resolution?
For transport assignments, can contract be re-released back to NYSEG?
Can EES provide a copy of the contract, capacity posting and back-up information for the bankruptcy files?

As always, there is a short turnaround time to complete Enron's response to the filing.

Please respond by Monday, March 4th.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Per my discussion with Sherry Glazebrook at Tennessee, she wasn't real specific since I don't have an EES ID on Tennessee but this is what I found out.

CONTRACTS

Balancing Agreement K# 31905 (OBAD) This is a balancing agreement for Bethlehem on the 200 leg in Zone 5, probably meter #20816. This balancing agreement should have been cashed out every month. She wouldn't tell me the current balance. ENA had a term sale to EES (sitara #1003036). The volume was 1,200 dth per day in Tenn Zone 5 and the name of the point was Bethlehem Sales. The term of the sale matches the term of the capacity release from Boston Gas.
Firm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38535 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38539 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company  All 3 capacity releases from NYSEG are non-recallable. In my opinion, this capacity should be the property of the customers EES was serving behind the NYSEG city gate and the capacity should go with the customers. But, I believe we need to address the LDC tariff issues along with the pipeline issues.
Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT)
Supply Aggregation Servic e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)

Of all the items shown above, I am more concerned with the Balancing Agreement k#31905. We need to know what has happened to the sales customers EES had at this point. I believe it was just one customer. How is this customer currently getting its gas? If Enron is still the operator of the balancing agreement at this point, does it "appear" that Enron is still using this agreement?

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.  Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will

1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada. Are there any special tax issues to address?

HEADER_CONTENT Do you know the answer to the tax question, or at least who to ask?
FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments? I hope we still have someone who can do that.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

HEADER_SUBJECT Sales to Midland Cogen
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT We stopped serving Midland Cogen on Sitara deals 340305 and 332163 effective 4/1/2002. There are trigger prices on both of these deals which automatically generates an invoice whether we physically serve the deal or not (see invoice number 36538SA for April 2002 production). For April 2002, these deals are generating a credit invoice in the amount of $390,748.50. I would like to take the trigger volumes to 0 effective 4/1/2002 for the term of the deal to see if this reverses out the credit created in April and keeps us from sending out a credit invoice in the future.

I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k. How does the grass look up at
Dad's. I am thinking we should maybe bale the hay. I have intentions of
going up there this coming weekend. You should have bought a boat during
the boat show. I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him
about a boat. Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat? Freshwater or
Saltwater. I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha. A friend of mine
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston
Whaler. I think the boat was around 21/23 '. The sides were approximately
6/8" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directly
behind that which served as a seat. It also had what I call a jack plate on
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom. He
could run in about 8" of h2o. If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150
horse Yamaha. That baby would fly. They are bay boats but Aubrey took his
out in the Gulf frequently. You should call Duane Davis. I bet he can find
you exactly what you want.

Buddy, did the Easter Bunny come to see you?

HEADER_SUBJECT Sonat Park & Loans and Sale to Sonat
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan. I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing an additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.



Chris's notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,  SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure. There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out. I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco. Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169). I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day. Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.

TDC stated that it would "file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002. Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.

Kay, Ed, Question: I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court. Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC? Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

Re: First Collection Milestone Achieved

Several weeks ago, we told you we believed we had hit our first cash collection milestone, and indeed we have. Representatives for the unsecured creditors' committee and the ENA examiner are currently validating our cash collections and we expect them to verify the milestone very soon. The bankruptcy court judge has also signed the official motion related to the retention and LIP plans, so it is final with no additional follow-up with the court required. Soon, all the pieces will be in place to make our first Liquidation Incentive Pool dispersement. Because it will be our first dispersement, we are taking the needed time to establish an accurate and equitable process for this and future payouts. We plan to hold a meeting with all LIP participants in the next week or two to walk through the procedures we've developed and answer any questions. We'll be in contact with you soon to schedule that meeting.

HEADER_CONTENT Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.  Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will

1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada. Are there any special tax issues to address?

REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

HEADER_CONTENT To: Enron Employees Worldwide
From: Steve Cooper
I am disappointed to announce the resignation of Cindy Olson as executive vice president of Human Resources and Employee Relations, effective July 15, 2002. After nearly 25 years with Enron, Cindy has decided to leave to assist her husband in his trucking and transportation business. Her commitment and enthusiasm, even during these difficult times, have been inspiring and will be missed.
Robert Jones, managing director in Human Resources, will assume Cindy's responsibilities and join Enron's Management Committee. Robert joined Enron in 1980 and has held numerous managerial positions.

HEADER_CONTENT Chris

I checked our tariff and with our in house council and there is nothing that
precludes us from assisting you with marketing this capacity. In fact, our
tariff provides for it in Section 28.15 of the General Terms & Conditions
(Transporter & Shipper negotiate a "marketing fee" for Transporter to
actively market capacity on behalf of Shipper). So as not to set a
precedent of doing it for free, I've attached a letter agreement for a token
$1 marketing fee. What is the protocol (and likelihood) of having something
like this signed?

Once the capacity is offered and a replacement shipper is found, all three
parties would sign a permanent release agreement, a pro forma of which is
also attached. Basically it outlines who the parties are, what agreements
are in place, and takes all the liability (and right of first refusal) off
of you and puts it on the Replacement Shipper. Enron has signed a similar
agreement in the past regarding the majority of volumes on the same contract
when it released them to ProGas in 1997.

Please call me to discuss and/or if you need the relevant tariff page faxed
to you.

Since you are not using the smaller contract at all, and it is a true
Enron contract (as opposed to capacity release), you can release that one
as well, to anyone. We may be able to help you find a home for it. The
liability right now is about $27,000 a month.
Call me to discuss.

HEADER_CONTENT Ed,

The person that you mentioned this morning failed to make it to our meeting . Not a big deal but, as a result, I want to catch you up with where things are.

We established that:
(i) it is going to be very difficult to determine a fair market value for the put option;
(ii) Greg Sharp is going to speak with McConnell this morning about obtaining the necessary support for buying the option;
(iii) Greg is going to determine all amounts currently owed (and past due) from Bridgeline to ENA;
(iv) we need you to help us confirm the amount of gas in storage (Hugh Connett suggested that their numbers show about 1.93 BCF);
(v) I am going to circle up with PWC and Blackstone (after hearing back from Greg) to talk about the deal and get their reactions; and
(vi) I am going to speak with Bridgeline on a preliminary basis about some of the deal terms (in particular (a) the option price, (b) doing the gas sale earlier and escrowing the proceeds, (c) mitigation of damages and how that mitigation should affect the amounts (both pre and post-petition) that are owed by ENA to Bridgeline and (d) increasing the amount payable for the gas in storage (because this deal is distinguishable from the pad gas sale in that we will be paying for the transport to move it)).

Let's visit on this when you get a moment. Also please help me with item (iv) above. Finally, I need you to tell me if you are OK with how this thing is shaping up.

Chris recommends that we go with Bridgeline's number, as it is much more likely to be accurate at this point. If Rita Wynne has time and it does not delay your efforts, you could have her attempt to reconcile the balance.
REPLY_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Rita FYI - I told Ed that I would go with Bridgeline's number because
1. it is more conservative
2. the difference is small
3. that some trader may not have put in a deal or volume management didn't path the deals correctly....anything is possible with the turnover we have had.

If you have reconciled the numbers and know where the difference is let me know.

HEADER_CONTENT fyi,

you guys can really help your child in the future by giving her lots of sensory input. by sensory input i mean: swaddling, stroking down her arms, legs and back with different textures. (diffferent types of fabric, ie, satin, terry cloth, knit etc....) there is also a sensory brush but i don't know about it's use on babies.

the reason i say this is that my children both have a sensory deficiency. my little one, jerald, goes to occupational therapy once a week for sensory input. which is really nothing more than alot of fun play activities that incorporate the senses.

in the information i was given to read for jerald, they mentioned a link between c-section babies and sensory deficiits. they claim that alot of sensory input occurs when the baby is pushed through and out of the birth canal which c-section babies obviously miss. i don't know how true this is but the sensory input can't hurt her.

Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will
1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada. Are there any special tax issues to address?

Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

HEADER_CONTENT Kathryn (EES Volume Management) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers for EES. Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department. We may have to do that anyway. I'm not sure what this report is called, I just know its on a 2 month lag. I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB). If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me. If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.

Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this. If the person that handled Dominion is gone, then I'll just go the "legal" route.

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow. I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far. Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this. But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should. I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need. I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this? Let me know. If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify? I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy. Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee. Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I just spoke with Theresa Vos. She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers. Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU. There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity. It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too. We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at? I'd like to see that if possible.

I guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in Sitara or Unify.

HEADER_CONTENT Chris,
I work with Richard in the Chicago office. I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston. Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC. The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled? With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.
FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys. Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months. In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system. We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system. BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies. Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion? Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

Another thing that bothers me is the economy. All I hear about are layoffs. The only industry still booming is the energy industry and we keep streamlining. That's what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a house.

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now.

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the
application.

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons:
(1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names
into the group.
(2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the
messages after typing the
messages into the text box:
(1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
(2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second.
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10
second. Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT ** High Priority **

I received a call this afternoon from the VNG - TCO Account Manager. VNG
incurred pipeline overrun charges from Nov 17th - 21st. TCO stated ENA used
VNG capacity to deliver to other markets {Hopewell Power Plant}. TCO
notified Enron and VNG of the allocation problem during the month of
November, 2000. Although TCO assured Enron that the predetermined allocation
methodology would be corrected to allow VNG rights to pull under the contract
first, however, based on the conversation with TCO, corrections were not
made. Therefore, VNG incurred overrun charges under the VNG contract @
$10.00/dth totaling $560,000+.

Please notify pipeline to reconcile and provide AGLES with pipeline invoices
for November, 2000. ENA is responsible for all penalties associated with
this transaction.

****************
1) Enron NA was never notified by TCO of any penalty, overrun on VNG contract
or pipeline OFO situation during the November 18-21 time period.

2) Denise Dotson was notified by VNG gas control on the morning of November
20th about the overrun situation above. The VNG gas control experienced the
problem but did not notify Enron or AGL until Monday morning.

3) Enron immediately placed ranking system in Navigator to make VNG first
priority. This was completed Monday afternoon November 20th.

4) On Tuesday morning 11/21, Denise Dotson once again called Enron stating
that the previous night VNG attempted to pull maximum volumes from  storage
contracts only to overrun contract due to ENA nominations to other delivery
points. Joann Collins called her Columbia team and was told that the
ranking was not applicable after the last confirmation cycle on any gas day
with no-notice contracts. Ranking has zero effect with the late night
schedulers.

5) Enron dropped the Hopewell nomination from the VNG contract(s) effective
11/22.

HEADER_CONTENT The deal 226556 with volume of 4991 was billed and paid separately. Volume
was supposed to be 5000 (B&B still wants the 9 difference). I just talked

some paper. He also indicated that this citygate gas was nommed into CES's

WRP










Victor and Robert,
Please let us know if you can be of any help on this one. The only deal with
volumes that I see for Beldan and Blake is deal 226556 and it appears to have
been netted with a CES deal 235398, in which case there would be nothing in
navigator. The deal that I believe Wade is referring to is 345224, but it is
showing a zero volume in unify.

Terry, I see several deals out there for Beldan and Blake all at NYSEG but
with different prices. The only one with volume is 226556 for a total volume
of 4991. Is possible that all the volume may have been put on the one deal
and should have been spread amongst the several deals?

Thanks!

Kathy

Volume Management (Angel Fuller), has been unable to locate any volumes for
Belden & Blake for May-00 NFGD PA (National Fuel Gas) gas under Columbia Gas
Transmission. She researched her actuals and looked on Columbia Navigator
under ENA and NFGD PA and was unable to find volumes as invoiced. B&B is
invoicing for 1302 mcf. The Sitara deal that was used for March used CGAS
Point 21 NYSEG 02 Constrained Citygate and has pricing of $3.30 as per the
invoice.

Can you give us any more clues as to where we might find this gas? Some
place else on Navigator? Can B&B supply us with some kind of statement?

Please let me know.

On Thursday, December 7,2000, IOGA WV and Dominion Transmission (formerly CNG
Transmission) announced that they have reached a five year agreement on
gathering rates. Although this agreement is subject to FERC's approval,
there should be no problem having FERC OK.

This agreement becomes effective January 1, 2001. Under the agreement,
Dominion WILL NOT invoice either the producer or his agent (i.e. ENA) for
gathering or processing. Instead, Dominion will increase the gas retention
percentages to cover the costs of both gathering and processing. They are:

1/1/2001 - 6/30/2003
7/1/2003 - 12/31-2005

Transmission Dry
0                             0
Transmission Wet
3.91%                         3.51%
Gathering Dry
9.34%                          9.34%
Gathering Wet
13.25%                        12.85%

As of yesterday, Dominion was not sure exactly how they will communicate the
production information to the producer and/or his agent. My guess is that
they will send a monthly statement which willl have two volumes for each
meter. The first volume will be the wellhead volume delivered to the meter
(a gross volume) . This volume will be adjusted by the retention percentage
which will equate to the sales volume (gross volume less gathering and/or
processing). The sales volume will be the volume we will pay the producer
for since it will be net of gathering and/or processing. There will be no
additional charges. ENA will not be required send monies to Dominion.

As additional information becomes available, I will forward.

HEADER_CONTENT Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240)
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had to tranfer the
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at
Friday's P&L. This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday resulting in taking the
Sunday's gain away from your book.

Let me know if we need to discuss further. thanks.

Per our discussion on Monday, we need to give CES-Retail a bid for the two
TCO transportation contracts that were dedicated to c&i customers that they
will no longer need once they sell their c&i business effective 6/1/00. As
you recall, one contract is to COH for 20,000/d through 10/31/00 (#65402);
the other is to BG&E for 19,000/d through 4/01(#65403). This is the
information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me--you need to confirm that
this information is accurate.

I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest
that he talk to one of you two directly for a bid on the agreements. I think
this will be more efficient (and put the pressure on you to price it
up!!).  If there is any problem with this, please let me know.

HEADER_CONTENT It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen. We recogniz e that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w e are pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success through Enron stock options.
As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t he All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu e to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program.
Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid ed to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib le on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran t of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O ption Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program. To provide information and answer your question s, we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo ur Human Resources representative.
Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant ing of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal regulatory requirements. It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enr on companies=01, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business issues. As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the marketplaces we serve. Given that need to change, we will continue to refi ne the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being determined on December 29, 2000.

Technology has helped Enron create new businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com. You =01,ve seen what technology can do at work. Now we want you and your family to realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t he ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips.
We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000 software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries; however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT , Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business reasons. Eligibility includes being employed at the time of implementation. ? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter. Delive ry of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized. To address some of your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on http://clickathome.enron.com. We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne ar future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.
We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your family. We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve l by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe Enron is a great place to work.

Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999. (Applause
here!) Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled via a manual line item.

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type. For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity. Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting. Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close. The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31. This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara. Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month. For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator. They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
forward.

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting... Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as
possible. This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible. I'm not sure how you or
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating
transport p&l. In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas. These could
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates. The
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES
business in our portfolio, the times have changed. Currently we are using
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and
how we are marking the curves. For example, today's Gas Daily postings
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY  GAS DAILY SPREAD  SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985  $1.565   $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39  $ .585   $.16
CNG South $3.305  $ .670   $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong. There are
two solutions that I see. One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace. That's up to you.
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it),
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. However, we

Subject: Re: Peoples

Questions that I have:
1) I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.) This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production. If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.

2) If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3) Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?

4) If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
Phillips  Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you
can anwser this.

The offsetting dollar amount for the 9612 production adjustment
(K#016-21045-306C) was $121,080.16. This adjustment however was reversed
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in
11/97 GL and subsequently written off in 01/98 GL at the time the company was
sold. I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it.

I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we are
going to make to Co.366 ($463,609.20) and the actual dollars in the system
($498,824.82). He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct.

Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what
the amount would be. Thanks,

Vivien

The 9612 production adjustment received from Transco was a reduction in
volume of (33,517). There was a ($2,734.99) Commodity adjustment and a
($124,582.69) Cash Out adjustment for a total credit from Transco of
($127,317.68). ECT took this credit. This volume adjustment was entered in
the sales system in 10/97 reducing the sales volume to Enron Louisiana from
284,890 to 251,373 on K#016-21045-306C. I don't know what the offsetting
dollar amount would be for the sales adjustment but someone in Client
Services should be able to get this info.

Subject: Enron Louisiana Mtg. 8/3

I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday. Tracy is expecting
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production
month adjustment. What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2) pass it through to
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3)
cut a check to Trans Canada? Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00? I believe it depends on
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

Chris,

In order for the I/C imbalance between ECT and ELEC be resolved by August
month-end close, a wire or check made payable to Co.366 needs to be prepared
by the end of this week.

Please advise me the amount that needs to be made so that I can prepare a
manual wire/check this week. I'll contact Inez Haberl regarding the payee's
bank information.

Remember the demand charge that was entered in the sales side that you killed
about a week ago?(deal # 233091) Well, the demand charges need to be in the
purchase side not the sales side. Per Bay State, Enron should be paying the
demand charges. Are they correct??? Bay State is also charging interest for
late payment. Please let me know if you need any more information.

Hi team. Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO. As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working. So, this is what I need to know;

Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

OK this is metered production on CNG.

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES
production.

After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal
in Sitara with a zero volume.

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999. (Applause
here!) Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled via a manual line item.

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type. For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity. Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting. Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close. The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31. This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara. Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month. For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator. They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
forward.

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting... Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1. We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for
production months older than 12/1999. This allows us to focus our efforts on
current month. Per Bryce, applaud here!

2. Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3. Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4. Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator. Changes should be made
effective 12/1999 production forward.

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions. If
necessary, please forward to your teams.

Hi team. Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO. As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working. So, this is what I need to know;

Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type. Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day


Computer Gender

An English teacher was explaining to the students
the
concept of gender
association in the English language; noting how
hurricanes at one time were
given only female names, and how ships and planes
were
usually referred to
as "she." One of the students raised her hand and
asked,
"What gender is a
computer?"

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class
into two
groups: males
in one, females in the other, and asked them to
decide if
a computer should
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked
to give
four reasons for
their recommendations.

The group of women concluded that computers
should be
referred to as
masculine because:

1. In order to get their attention, you have to
turn them
on.

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.

3. They are supposed to help you solve your
problems, but
half the time,
they ARE the problem.

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that,
if you
had waited a
little longer, you could have had a better model.

The men, on the other hand, decided that
computers
should definitely be
referred to as feminine because:

1. No one but their creator understands their
internal
logic.

2. The native language they use to communicate
with other
computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else.

3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in
long-term
memory for later
retrieval.

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you
find
yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago,
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented
capacity. Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement
shipper. Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not)
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible. For instance,
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on
Iroquois' system? Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments
on this issue. I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

Thanks.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Subject: TRANSCO PROPRIETARY FILE

Dave,

As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES
contracts as well
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union. Our proprietary file contacts the
business party id, rather
than the DUNS number. Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's
business party id. These
are the valid business parties we use:

ENA  5304
Brooklyn Union  21995
Columbia Energy Services 5092
Columbia Energy Marketing 7772

As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various
producers, we will
need to include their business parties as well. For now, this is all we
need. In the meantime,
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert
into Unify as do not
send??

Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking. We spend a
great deal of time
overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity to
be cut as we need
it. Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swing
activity to 899??

Thanks for you help.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool
EMAIL_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
Phillips  Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you
can anwser this.

Hi. Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st. I had requested 145 dth per day on
Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler. For some reason Chris
Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth. PSNC
called
me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled. I instructed PSNC to
contact Chris. Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth
on
the first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second. I did this.
This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March
1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed. I called my transco scheduler and
she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled.
(impossible as capacity was released to Enron). All I wanted was 145 dth per
day for March. Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what should
and did get scheduled? Thank you.

EMAIL_START

To:? Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and
Shippers

Re: Transco Files a Motion for Modification of Settlement to
??? Permit Interim Partial Refunds
??? Docket Nos. RP97-71-000 and RP97-312-000

In response to certain customers' requests, Transco submits a
Motion for Modification of Settlement to Permit Interim Partial
Refunds in the above-captioned proceedings. By this motion,
Transco requests that the Commission modify Article V of the
January 20, 1998 Stipulation and Agreement to permit Transco to
make an interim partial refund of amount to Non-Contesting
Parties, if any, related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return
Issues on or about October 31, 2000. The refund is being made to
parties in advance of the date that such refunds are due as set
forth in the Stipulation and Agreement, in part to help mitigate
the effects of current high natural gas prices on their
customers. For further detailed information of the Motion filed
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, please refer to
Transco's filing today in the above mentioned dockets.

Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on
or about October 31,2000 to Non-Contesting Parties related to the
Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to
those customers with interest from the date of payment to the
date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May 1, 1997
through February 29,2000 in excess of the amount that would have
been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the
Commission's findings in its March 17, 2000 order in Docket No.
RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues,
subject to the "refund floor". These interim partial refunds will
be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any
supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for
the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon
request.

If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim
partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final
Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital
Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds
related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non-
Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on
or before October 25, 2000, of its election not to participate in
the interim partial refunds.

CDC could invoke $30 per dth penalty plus the tariff cost.  I will not know

they will invoke this until after they close the month.

Subject: CKY 6-12 January 2000 - cut 29th 767 dth

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.  However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.  They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.   When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.  I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.  I
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.  I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.  I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.  She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.  She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).  I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.  However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.  I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short, we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).  Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

to
you. However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an

David
Is there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market
area pipes to the Market East p&l? If the only reason is that you're not
sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion. It seems to me that there are
only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee,
Texas Eastern and Transco. For now, why don't we leave all the demand
charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the
East p&l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East
book: Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG,
Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel.

Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to
make sense to me. Please advise.

on our monthly CNG Demand billing. This is showing us that you should have
been billed this amount by CNG Transmission and then in turn you should
bill us these amounts.

If you need any backup in regards to these demand charges, please notify me
by e-mail or you may call me at (315) 460-4122. These amounts are showing
outstanding in our accounting statements, so therefore, I will be happy to
assist you in any way I can to get these amounts paid. When billing,
please fax me a copy of your complete bill and also mail an original in the

Gloria and Wade,

You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these

gathering and some were straight transmission, which did not have any
gathering. Again, these meters will now have a $.25 gathering charge.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

David, Sea Robin Pool is a zone on the Sea Robin Pipeline (SEAR). The Sea
Robin Pool zone includes many different meters some of which do have a prefix
of ISRP. However, there are also other meters in that zone that have the
following prefixes: LSRP, FSRP and PSRP. I mapped the entire zone to the new
curves you sent us. Given your message it seems like things might not be
peachy after all if you only wanted the ISRP meters mapped that way. Please
call me as soon as you get a chance.

REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I think the best thing to do would be to create a separate zone for all of
those ISRP meters. The traders typically take deals from ISRP to the Pool
and incur transport. Therefore having two zone would more accurately
represent what is actually happening.

I am in London helping Brent Price with some audit work that he is doing.

Subject: Re: Sea Robin Well Head Curve

Well, whenever we map specific meters on a zone to curves that are different
than what the entire zone is mapped to, we create an alternative facility
mapping for each specific meter that you want mapped differently. Currently,
there are 137 active meters on the Sea Robin Pool zone with a prefix of
ISRP. That would mean I would have to create 137 alternative facility
mappings. Another alternative would be to have all of those meters moved to
their own zone and then just create one mapping for that whole zone.
However, this will also take a great deal of time, since Global Facilities
would have to change the zone on every single facility record. Plus, we
would have to see what type of activity is on all of these meters and we
would have to update the zone on all of these deals after Global Facilities
made it's change. So, let me know what your thoughts are. What are you
doing in London???

HEADER_SUBJECT  
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Vince and Vasant:

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for
overhead expenses. A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 . The trader's spread is
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity.
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet). For South Texas and
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc). And, once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

Hope - approximately 1224 dth per day (this does not include Bayer and Eagle
Glass will swing)

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio. I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4585 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.  This will leave 382 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.  Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.  Thanks.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool

Heidi
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. However, we
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples

Questions that I have:
1) I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.) This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production. If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.

2) If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3) Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?

4) If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the

Singer). Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

HEADER_CONTENT This deal haunts us every month. Need someone to verify that CES GMS pricing
equals Enron's Sitara pricing.

Just a reminder, the GMS report I used from CES system only had volumes and
no pricing. I ensured the physical volumes were correct. Commerical still
needs to verify the pricing on the deals. I don't think this has been done
yet.

CES DEAL TICKETS
gms ticket # = s-dpl-0070
term = 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001
volume = 5000

gms ticket # = s-dpl-0079
term = 12/1/99 to 5/1/200
volume = 5000



ENA DEAL TICKETS
135702 = 5000.
It appears I changed volume to 0 on 2/29


145321 = 10,000
This ticket has been used for the total 10,000. This may be incorrect. (April
forward deal # is 227296).

The physical total volume is correct in Sitara, not sure about the pricing.

We need to determine if this is another data entry error, or if CES provided

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT cc:

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2: The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue. Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3. Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.  Here is what is happening: Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.  We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers. So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items. That's problem one. Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations. We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want). For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.  I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4. Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you. Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges. This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. Let us know what
you would prefer. Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29. Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7. I apologize for the delay.

5. Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday. Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
balances.

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers. The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day


It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume
of
the increase. That is an estimate. Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you.

HEADER_CONTENT According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below. We have 3 options on serving this deal:
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1. Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost. However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below. For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou. The total transport cost is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month). We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price and the transport expense?

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool

Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. However, we
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples

Questions that I have:
1) I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.) This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production. If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.

2) If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3) Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?

4) If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you

Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300
day from Phillips Production. That works out to about 429 day.

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be
4,000 for the month.

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it, CNG scheduler) has
agreed to help out any way she can. She knows escript pretty well. Chat
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure
out how to run all the reports we need back to January. Also, we will not
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to
Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool
gas.

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly
easy.

Hi Paul and Chris,
Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month. Did you guys do a deal for this gas too? He usually nominates
it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do
it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th). I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was
not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out
there
yet.
I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do. Just give me the word and I
will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is
the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it. Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

"Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they
send to Gloria, I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn.
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend.
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to
cause unnecessary pain.

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are
not reflected in the books. Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to
book since there is flexibility in the takes. Also, he said he has a strong
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it. Dick
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now. So Chris
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked. You can do what you want, but
I still think we should book it. The flexibility in takes is only 10% so
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't
book anything. Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to. In addition, per our
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year. This
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term. And finally, what if
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you
want.

HEADER_CONTENT Greetings,

Thanks for the TV. and Jaime also said Thanks for the bed room suite.
Chris, I found Dad's old pistol. It was under the dresser in his bed room.
I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left. It is
captured in a pistol storage case. I stuck it in behind the sheets and
things. I saw Chad and Angela on my way out. They are a great couple.
Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work. I am going
to get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if he
wants to lease Dad's pasture.
As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year. You had said we do not want to
pay for a fence along the creek. When I have leased places in the past I
have had to build new fence at my own expense. Most folk's base their
cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation. If I built fence
and that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,
then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,
excluding my labor. Something to think about. I hope we do not own that
place for five more years. Gerald also said he would mow the grass around
the house and sort of keep the place tuned up.

Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead. They placed her in
Angleton/Danbury for overnight observation. I think she required about
seven stitches in her head. There were x-rays taken and her lungs are
pretty much gone. Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech can
read his prints.

Stopped by and saw Bernie Max. Now where did they come up with a name like
that? They removed the lymph glands from his neck. Starting down the torso
just at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down the
torso about six or seven inches. A triangle shape about the size of a piece
of large pizza. The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep into
his body. The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue. They took a pretty
big chunk out of his chest. He had a six " x eight " piece of skin removed
from his left thing for a skin graft. It looked pretty painful. He was in
good spirits and bull corning around.

I guess that is about it. I would like to have a timber appraisal performed
on the Dad's place. I'll be chatting with you guys. Oh, I forgot the dang
remote to the TV. I really was not for sure which one it was. I think I
need it to program the darn thing. Keep your powder dry.

Y'all be safe,

HEADER_CONTENT cc:

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2: The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue. Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3. Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.  Here is what is happening: Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.  We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers. So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items. That's problem one. Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations. We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want). For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.  I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4. Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you. Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges. This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. Let us know what
you would prefer. Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29. Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7. I apologize for the delay.

5. Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday. Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
balances.

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type. Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type. Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k. How does the grass look up at

going up there this coming weekend. You should have bought a boat during
the boat show. I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him
about a boat. Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat? Freshwater or
Saltwater. I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha. A friend of mine
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston
Whaler. I think the boat was around 21/23 '. The sides were approximately
6/8" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directly
behind that which served as a seat. It also had what I call a jack plate on
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom. He
could run in about 8" of h2o. If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150
horse Yamaha. That baby would fly. They are bay boats but Aubrey took his
out in the Gulf frequently. You should call Duane Davis. I bet he can find
you exactly what you want.

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible. For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it. I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one). Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up. I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please

Where Did the Value Go at Enron?
By FLOYD NORRIS
<<...OLE_Obj...>>
hat really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen?
Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE >) released its quarterly earnings a week ago. Yesterday shares in Enron plunged $5.40, to $20.65, after the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions.
The reaction was in some ways puzzling. Given the questions that have been raised since the earnings announcement - some of them prominently featured in The Wall Street Journal - it was likely that the S.E.C. would begin a preliminary inquiry.
Whether it will go farther than that is not clear, but if nothing else the slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confront a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet value to dribble out. Enron's shares rose 67 cents, to $33.84, last Tuesday, as investors first reacted to the earnings announcement. But since then they have fallen $13.19, or 39 percent.
The $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity was not mentioned in a news release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday. It was briefly mentioned in a conference call with analysts, but many of the listeners seem to have not noticed that, wrongly thinking Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, was referring to a $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings release.
When questions were asked in the following days, the explanations were less than thorough. Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders' equity was related to the termination of "structured finance vehicles" involving partnerships that had been controlled by the company's chief financial officer.
"Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how the company goes about its business," said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit analyst at Fitch Investors Service. He added that the issue of the company's "credibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its own."
Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its financial reports. But last night it said Mr. Lay would hold another conference call with investors at 9:30 a.m. today.
The company's earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many analysts. They referred to such things as "share settled costless collar arrangements" and "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts." The disclosures said the company entered into the transactions "to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets."
It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall Street Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investors, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distributions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have refused to discuss the arrangements in any detail.
One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the termination of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item, or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earnings. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.
Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot produce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company that sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1, will report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to shareholders equity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, "is the result of Enron's termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods."
Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the details were not clear, "Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount of Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and they were not" worth that much.
Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some expenses, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is disclosed only in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The reduction in shareholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released.
Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to provide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling later resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the chairman and former chief executive, took back the latter title.
While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the dominant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce phenomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important role in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was only enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.
But now, with some of the company's ventures clearly having run into problems, it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the company's reports. That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was because of the involvement of the chief financial officer, and some have wondered if there might have been similar deals with others.
Mr. Lay has promised to make the company's financial reports easier to understand, and last week's report was at first praised by some analysts for doing just that.
In a news release yesterday, Mr. Lay said the company welcomed the S.E.C.'s request for information. "We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest," he said.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate. Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup). Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on
days
after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have
forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't
worry
about it.

How are you doing? It has been a few years since we've seen each other.
John Fitzpatrick asked that I send to you the GISB contract for your review.
If you will complete the information on the right-hand side of the first
page and email back to me I will prepare originals for execution.

HEADER_CONTENT Robin,

I have reviewed the GISB sent by Occi. The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB. I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.

The main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record. EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?

Paul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale. If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.

The third special provision, can go either way, your call?

The fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?

Normally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement. I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.

Also, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read: Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.

Let me know later.

Christy

HEADER_CONTENT Robin,

Just to let you know, we rehashed the GISB yesterday and sent our final comments to Occidental yesterday afternoon. We have not heard back yet. We needed to make sure we had provided for the fact you do not record, you want them to prepay, no netting,setoff, etc. I also advised that ENA wanted to be the confirming party. Hopefully we will hear from them soon as I am sure they want to start the ball rolling as soon as possible.

Will you need my help with confirmations? I am glad to help you unless you have other sources, but we especially now need to have the written confirmations done, with the appropriate bankruptcy language.

Thanks again for your help.

REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my
system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it
AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days
after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have
forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry
about it.
REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Because you have a discount before and after makes little difference - some
people call some days and not the next. Kathy has called on Saturday and

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

HEADER_CONTENT Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.

We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.

If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop. Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.

Plumbing Mystery of Deals by Enron
<<...OLE_Obj...>>
T the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Corporation (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE >) are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. Because they were transactions among related parties, the company was required to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the currently available answers.
Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?
A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it said it was seeking to "hedge certain merchant investments and other assets," by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies.
Q. How did those investments do?
A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclosure on that.
Q. Why can't that be discerned?
A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transactions with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivative securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely.
Q. Why were they so complicated?
A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each and then buys them back - whether for $1 or $50 - there is no gain or loss. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet - in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule.
Q. Who made money from these transactions?
A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors.
Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?
A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important.
Q. When were concerns raised with Enron?
A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By this summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships.
Q. How did Enron do?
A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it also reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.
Q. How did that happen?
A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnership owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enron. In return, Enron terminated "previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods." Enron treated that like a share buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings.
Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules?
A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on them. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS

HEADER_CONTENT Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

Subject: Re: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John
Singer). Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool

Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost

are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES

their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you

We are calling on Jim Javin and John Singer to rule only on exceptions or conflicts in data. Also, we are meeting with Logistics and IT to establish a workable solution to clear-up paths with more than one deal. Our review of the Appalachian data is based primarily on wellhead activity from the following sources:

Path Manager Supply =01) This gives us the ability to sort data easily, pro vide views of deals and path relationships. This screen allows us to identify duplicate deals under the same meter and incorrect trading desk assignments . We can also trace purchase information to the transport detail.

This list permits us to compare purcha se price deducts vs. transport payments by meter. (Manual payments and the inconsistencies in the Unify set-up of pipe structures will require additional effort in this area.) The end result of our efforts will provid e:

a deal reference for meters listed more than once
consolidation of wellhead deals by pipe
correct Market East regional designation
purchase deducts not corresponding to pipeline payments
meters without purchase payments
incorrect price adjustments for transport cost

A status update has been scheduled for August 15 at 1 PM in room EB 3014.  Our goal is to have completed Gatherco and CNR wellheads. To date our progress has revealed:

On Thursday, December 7,2000, IOGA WV and Dominion Transmission (formerly CNG
Transmission) announced that they have reached a five year agreement on
gathering rates. Although this agreement is subject to FERC's approval,
there should be no problem having FERC OK.

This agreement becomes effective January 1, 2001. Under the agreement,
Dominion WILL NOT invoice either the producer or his agent (i.e. ENA) for
gathering or processing. Instead, Dominion will increase the gas retention
percentages to cover the costs of both gathering and processing. They are:

1/1/2001 - 6/30/2003
7/1/2003 - 12/31-2005

Transmission Dry
0                             0
Transmission Wet
3.91%                         3.51%
Gathering Dry
9.34%                          9.34%
Gathering Wet
13.25%                        12.85%

As of yesterday, Dominion was not sure exactly how they will communicate the
production information to the producer and/or his agent. My guess is that
they will send a monthly statement which willl have two volumes for each
meter. The first volume will be the wellhead volume delivered to the meter
(a gross volume) . This volume will be adjusted by the retention percentage
which will equate to the sales volume (gross volume less gathering and/or
processing). The sales volume will be the volume we will pay the producer
for since it will be net of gathering and/or processing. There will be no
additional charges. ENA will not be required send monies to Dominion.

As additional information becomes available, I will forward.

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999. (Applause
here!) Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled via a manual line item.

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type. For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity. Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting. Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close. The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31. This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara. Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month. For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator. They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
forward.

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting... Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

HEADER_CONTENT Actually, the deal is for 773/day @ into CPA via the Carnegie-Jefferson
interconnect. The price is NX1 + $0.12/Dth; the contract expires 11/01/00.
This gas only flowed for a part of February and is not flowing for March.
CPA closed the interconnect with Carnegie for their own needs/system supply.
This gas may not flow for the rest of the contract. CPA will only operate
the interconnect on a day-to-day basis; no firm is available. I am to check
with CPA to see if they will do an exchange for this gas.

HEADER_CONTENT Actually, prior to the CES acquisition we had between 200 and 500 little
wells of metered production in the Appalachian area of our own. These wells
produce anywhere from 10 dt's to 10,000 dt's per day. Most are very minimal,
probably 500 dt's or less. This production is produced on several gathering
lines off of CNG and Columbia Gas. A couple of years ago Columbia Gas
started getting out of the gathering business and sold part of the wells to
Gatherco, then they spun off part to CNR, and the remainder are still held by
Columbia Gas. Around the 10th of the month we get estimates from Gatherco
and CNR as to what it appears that the individual wells are producing and
then we nominate the gas, which takes up to several hours of updating time.
The Columbia Gas meters we do not have to individually nominate to the pipe.
We receive an estimate from the pipe for the total volume and they give us
credit for it in our pool. Sounds simple. The problem comes three months
down the road when we get the actuals from Columbia Gas as to what flowed at
these meters and accounting has to go in and make payments to all these
little producers.

Prior to unify, it didn't really effect us. Client Services would just zero
out the one lump estimate that we had made and then they would go in and add
each producer, the wells that flowed, the volume and make the final payment
to each. It was a very time consuming process and they had one person who
was solely devoted to doing nothing but this. Because unify was developed to
put as much work up front in the process, client services no longer has the
'back door' to get the payment out the door. This means that each well that
we have on Columbia Gas must now have an individual ticket in sitara with a
volume of 0 (currently our responsibility to set up) and must have at least
one path with a volume of 1 for each month in unify. Several months ago
after converting to unify, Robert, Molly Lafuze, Kathy Moore, and Victor put
in a massive effort over the course of about three weeks to get all of our
own meters taken care of while still maintaining their respective jobs.
Generally, it's the same meters that flow and when we set them up, we do it
over a long period of time so the path just rolls from one month to next and
as long as we keep up our tracking and balancing, we're just in maintenance
mode. However, sometimes new wells come up, at which point the process is to
1) have the global group set up the meters and the counterparties, 2) set up
a deal in sitara, 3) put a path in unify with a volume of 1, 4) create noms,
and 5) track and balance. Since we don't even get actuals to 3 months after
flow, we usually have at least 3 to 4 months of catch up to do. And of
course, as you are aware, our systems have been running a little slow lately.

With the acquisition of CES we have taken on even more of the gas. I've
heard on a couple of occasions just how many wells this is, but I'm sorry,
the number seems to have escaped me. I know it is at least several hundred
and that it is quit a bit more than we had previously.

This whole subject is one that has been passed around by several people
including myself, Chris Germany, John Singer, Jim Javins, and Scott Neal on
more than one occasion. One thought that John Singer and Jim Javins had was
to have someone named Hiedi in Jim's office get access to our systems and
input the gas herself. Seems like a nice suggestion, except that she is EES
and I don't think that we want her in our sytems. By the way, John Singer
and Jim Javins are the ones buying this wellhead gas. They picked Hiedi
because she works in the same office as Jim and they feel that she could give
these little guys the hand holding treatment that they sometimes demand.
Yes, it's hard to believe but it's the ones getting the $50 checks that
complain the most. They thought that Hiedi could also be responsible for
making the payments.

Anyway, that suggestion wasn't really panning out, so another suggestion has
arisen as to setting up a whole new Enron entity that would handle the
metered supply and we would be buying the gas from this entity. First, we
would have to take into consideration whether it would restrict our
flexibility on Columbia Gas.  I'm not totally sure how to go about getting
something like this off the ground, but it does have merit. Another thought
was to hire someone here that's sole responsibility would be the metered
supply. They would hopefully become a specialist in the area and would work
closely with Gloria in client services, Jim Javins and John Singer. The
thought was to have them report either to me or to Scott Neal. Chris and I
tend to disagree in this area. he thinks there is plenty of work for a full
time person. My opinion is that there is definitely a need for a special
project over the course of some time, but that once the initial push to get
the meters in is done that it is more of a part-time responsibility. The big
problem with that though is right now, the guys downstairs don't even have
time to get these special type of requests done and it might be faster for
Gloria to do them herself, if she has proper training and access to our
systems. However, regardless of which group gets the responsibility, there
is going to be a need for a very large effort within the next month or so
when January actuals come in and we should be prepared.

Any way, please give it some thought and let me know if you have any
suggestions. I'd also like to here what your views might be.

Thanks!

Subject: Re: Accounting stuff. Let me know what you find out. Thanks.

Bob,

After talking with Robert about this request this morning, I told him that I
would look at future option, but that in the meantime I would go ahead and
take care of these for Gloria. Well, to my shock, it took over three hours
for me to complete the task of setting up 2 deal in sitara and adding and
pathing 9 meters in unify over the course of six months. I'm not sure why I
thought this, but I thought it might take 30 maybe 45 minutes. The whole
process is really rather simple, just very time consuming. What scares me is
that we are soon going to be having to do exactly this same thing for the
hundreds of metered production wells that have come over with the CES
acquisition. At the current rate of business that we are doing, I just don't
see how will be able to accomplish this with our current resources.

We still have some time before we need to make a decision, but a couple of
possible solutions would be 1) bring in some temporary help for a short
period of time or 2) give Gloria access to help out with this, but then we
give up part of the control of our systems to other group.

HEADER_KEYWORDS ferc ldcs argued sfv 637
HEADER_SUBJECT Memo from Shelley Corman: FERC Staff Conference Today
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Today, FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are
necessary to promote further market liquidity. The conference was fairly
well attended by FERC staff, including Dan Larcamp and Shelton Cannon.

Some common themes:
Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not
necessary.
Commodity markets are very liquid.
FERC policies, GISB and Order 637 have helped to make capacity markets more
liquid.
Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in
Order No. 637 compliance filings.
Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity (with pipelines making the
distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea,
standardization of product offerings is not).
There is very little consensus on further areas for change. In nearly every
case, a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another.
In any event, most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes.

Areas without consensus:
Shipper-must-have-title rule. LDCs argue it should be removed; while Process
Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release
market.
Production area rate design. LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy
service downstrream of a market pool. Reliant and Koch also argued that
pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates.
The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area.
SFV. East Coast LDCs, Michcon, and APGA argued for moving off of SFV. The
producers and industrials oppose. Illinois Power/Dynegy also argued for
moving off SFV.


LDC Positions
The LDCs main themes were removing the shipper-must-have-title and enabling
LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers. However, they also argued
that pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric
generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically
enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs .  This is the point that AGA
raised in the blanket intervention to all Order 637 compliance filings.
Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are
entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a
best efforts basis, perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not
have been fully subscribed. LDCs, generally stating that 637 compliance
filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation, continued to stress
the need for segmentation, including "geographical segmentation of ROFR
capacity."

Some Specific Proposals
NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form 2 filings.
A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information,
though specific needs were not well defined.
Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties
(especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for
arbitrage).
Alliance of Energy Suppliers (marketing arm of EEI) called for a dialogue
between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly
variability. They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to
match the power grid (Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to
standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well).
The GISB End-User group (represented by Salt River Project) complained about
the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas
transactions to be "tagged" like electric transactions.

E-Commerce and Capacity Trading
Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity
trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy
transactions, remove posting periods and long contract execution periods. He
made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary.
Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme, admonishing the
FERC not to micro-manage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist
on a single platform. He said that liquidity cannot be legislated. From his
perspective, natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets
in the world. FERC should worry about transferring the "good stuff" from
natural gas to electric markets, not the reverse.

Good Afternoon.

Just a heads up so that you may contact Chris Germany. We have one customer
at
PSNC. Effective April 1st, CES will no longer be supplying gas to this
customer as their expires. I just do not want to have a mix up for April and
have Chris contract with PSNC for capacity when none will be needed. I am in
the process of notifing PSNC. Just wanted to keep you in the loop and give
you
the option to inform Chris.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index
published : April 19, 2000

ANR Gets Green Light for Transco Interconnect

ANR Pipeline last week won a two-year battle at FERC to build a direct
interconnect to Transcontinental
Gas Pipe Line's mainline facilities at Evangeline Parish, LA --- near
the site of an active natural gas sales
market.

On rehearing, the Commission upheld a July 1998 order granting a
complaint in which ANR accused
Transco of discriminating against it by denying a request to construct
minor interconnection facilities that
would provide its shippers with direct access to gas sales markets on
Transco's system at Evangeline.

Specifically, the Coastal Corp. pipeline has fought to obtain a direct
connection to Station 50, which is one
of several compressor stations on Transco's mainline serving as pooling
points. There, producers and
marketers sell gas to LDCs and other buyers who hold firm capacity on
Transco for shipment to
downstream markets. The gas sale market at Station 50 is said to be a
"premium one."

In order to get their gas to Station 50 now, ANR shippers must deliver
gas via ANR's existing
interconnection on Transco's Central Louisiana Lateral at Eunice, LA,
and then purchase interruptible
transportation (IT) service on Transco for a distance of about 7.4
miles. So, in effect, ANR shippers
currently must pay "stacked rates" for service on ANR's existing
interconnect and for service on Transco's
IT feeder to reach Station 50.

But the Commission last week found that ANR's request for a direct
interconnection at Evangeline was
reasonable under three different analyses. "First, the evidence shows
that Transco has provided no
reasonable justification for denying ANR's request, given Transco's
history of granting such requests made
by similarly situated parties," the order said [CP98-74]. Six pipelines
other than ANR currently have direct
interconnections on Transco's mainline in the Gulf region that were
established prior to Transco's
restructuring under Order 636, and none of the shippers pay an IT rate
in order to get gas to Transco's
mainline markets, according to the order.

Secondly, evidence suggests the denial of an interconnection for ANR
has led to "specific competitive harm
to the operations of sales markets on Transco's mainline," the
Commission said. That's because buyers at
Station 50 have been barred access to the competitively priced gas
supplies that ANR's shippers seek to
offer, FERC noted. Lastly, it said the establishment of the Evangeline
interconnect for ANR was required
under the new five-step interconnection policy for gas pipelines, which
FERC unveiled last week.

In upholding the July 1998 decision, the Commission overturned an
administrative law judge's (ALJ) initial
findings that competition hadn't been adversely harmed at Station 50,
and that FERC's prior approval of the
IT feeder system provided "appropriate support" for Transco to deny ANR
the Evangeline interconnect.

"We are persuaded by the record in this case that ANR cannot offer a
pipeline transportation service
reasonably competitive with those provided by Transco and other
interstate pipelines, without the
Evangeline interconnect, a minor facility consisting of valve access to
Transco's mainline," the order
concluded.

The Commission also rejected Transco's claim that it partly denied
ANR's request for the Evangeline
interconnect because it would have led to a revenue loss on its IT
Feeder system. As the FERC staff noted,
"six other interstate pipelines currently use mainline interconnects
[on Transco].....but no evidence indicates
the extent of even arguably identifiable business loss from these
pipeline competitors," the order noted. If
anything, "Transco has accorded itself an anti-competitive
preference.....to assure that its own IT service is
used in lieu of the potential alternative proposed by ANR."

FYI -- Press Release received this morning:

Cove Point LNG to Begin Open Season Process For Capacity at its LNG Receiving
Terminal
?
02/16/2000
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2000, PR Newswire)

HERNDON, Va, Feb. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a
subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, announced today that it will conduct an
open season from February 16 to March 16, 2000, for a firm LNG tanker
discharging service at its Cove Point LNG terminal. The new service will
include the unloading of LNG from tankers, LNG storage, vaporization, and
delivery of natural gas to points along Cove Point's existing pipeline.

Cove Point LNG is offering 750,000 dekatherms per day of deliverability and
4.25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of vapor equivalent storage capacity initially.
The service includes a proposed expansion of the available storage capacity
to 6.75 Bcf approximately one year after the start-up of the LNG receiving
operations. Pending approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
Cove Point LNG plans to begin the LNG tanker discharging service by late
2001.

Located in Lusby, Md., the Cove Point LNG terminal includes liquefied natural
gas storage and terminal operations, and an 87-mile natural gas pipeline that
connects with gas pipelines in Northern Virginia. The terminal has installed
send-out capacity of 1 Bcf of gas per day. With the proposed storage
expansion, total LNG storage at Cove Point will be 7.5 Bcf of vapor
equivalent natural gas. The Cove Point LNG terminal currently provides "peak
shaving" services to customers in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions.

Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading
energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its
operating companies engage in virtually all phases of the natural gas
business, including exploration and production, transmission, storage and
distribution, as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum
product sales, and electric power generation. Information about Columbia
Energy Group (NYSE: CG) is available on the Internet at
www.columbiaenergygroup.com.

This press release contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning
of the Federal securities laws, including statements concerning, on a
consolidated, segment or subsidiary basis, Columbia's plans, objectives and
expected performance. There can be no assurance that actual results will not
differ materially due to various factors, many of which are beyond the
control of Columbia, including, but not limited to, the regulatory approval
process, competition, weather, supply and demand for natural gas, and changes

To ensure everyone is on the same page.

500,000 over May's MMIQ was already approved and in TCO's gas control records.
200,000 to 300,000 additional was approved on Thursday, May 25, with Steve
Stonestreet, Julie Watkins, and Brian Adams, verbally on the phone.

Enron should have a total of 800,000 on gas control's books over May's MMIQ.
Joann needs a total of 822,000 to overinject for the month. Per my
conversation with Mike Ng, he will ask for the incremental 22,000; for a
total of 822,000. Mike will let us know if the incremental 22,000 has been
approved.

Joann also needs the 59,520 for May 31st for a daily overinjection which has
already been approved by Don Belcher at TCO.

Julie/Steve, please pass this note to Mike.... I don't have his e-mail
address.

HEADER_SUBJECT Transco capacity issue
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we
are buying. Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary. I would
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the
month. Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt
and delivery point on the contract. But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it
and I am unable to verify the information myself. It could have a big impact
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process? Let
me know if you need specific capacity examples.
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Colleen/Chris: I'm working from memory here, but I'm pretty sure that the
new Order 637 reporting requirements require the Index of Customers to list
the primary receipt and delivery points. However, in checking the FERC web
site, the pipelines are only required to update the Index of Customers
quarterly. Therefore, the indices filed under the new reporting requirements
won't be out until early October. I will look into this more closely when I
get back.

Chris -- Is your Penn Fuel release on Transco or Tennessee? I couldn't find
"Penn Fuel" on either the Transco or Tennessee Index of Customers as of
7/1/00. Do they have another "legal" name?

P.S. Here in western North Carolina, the high today was about 70 degrees.
It's sure going to be rough coming back to 100. But I understand y'all will
have a cool spell tomorrow. It's supposed to be way down to 92!! We'll be

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago,
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented
capacity. Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement
shipper. Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not)
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible. For instance,
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on
Iroquois' system? Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments
on this issue. I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10

EMAIL_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as
possible. This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible. I'm not sure how you or
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating
transport p&l. In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas. These could
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates. The
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES
business in our portfolio, the times have changed. Currently we are using
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and
how we are marking the curves. For example, today's Gas Daily postings
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY  GAS DAILY SPREAD  SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985  $1.565   $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39  $ .585   $.16
CNG South $3.305  $ .670   $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong. There are
two solutions that I see. One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace. That's up to you.
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it),
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

5. Are the LIP quarterly floor payments forward or backward? The LIP floor payments are quarterly payments that are off-settable to the milestone payments. In other words, the LIP floor payments are paid on a draw in advance of us meeting the milestones. The milestone payment would be off-set by any payment made under the quarterly floor requirement.

I hope this address your questions adequately.

HEADER_CONTENT Robin,

I have reviewed the GISB sent by Occi. The GISB between Occi and EES does NOT contain the special provisions contained in the within GISB. I can tell them we want the wording exactly the same, but we are dealing with different types of deals.

The main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record. EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?

Paul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale. If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.

The third special provision, can go either way, your call?

The fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?

Normally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement. I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.

Also, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read: Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.

Let me know later.

Just to let you know, we rehashed the GISB yesterday and sent our final comments to Occidental yesterday afternoon. We have not heard back yet. We needed to make sure we had provided for the fact you do not record, you want them to prepay, no netting,setoff, etc. I also advised that ENA wanted to be the confirming party. Hopefully we will hear from them soon as I am sure they want to start the ball rolling as soon as possible.

Will you need my help with confirmations? I am glad to help you unless you have other sources, but we especially now need to have the written confirmations done, with the appropriate bankruptcy language.

Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will

1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments? I hope we still have someone who can do that.

HEADER_CONTENT Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday. On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.

Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.

HEADER_CONTENT Drew,

I need to send out a payment of about $2.1 million next Tuesday to Reliant. The price is based off the NYMEX settle for today which we won't know until after 3:00 PM. And I prefer to wait until the day after NYMEX settles so I can see the price in a published document like Gas Daily. This puts us in a bit of a bind.

What I can do is prepare the cash request form today based off the NYMEX settle, that means you won't get it from me until after 3:30 PM. Monday morning I will verify the price in print, and get the signed wire request to you before 10:00 AM assuming Margaret, Ed, and Susan are all available to sign it. Phil already has an estimate for these amounts on the Gas Cash Forcast worksheet.

Let me know if this works for you.

HEADER_CONTENT The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M. Also you need to know
that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant. This means that
what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
you burn. Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
during this time period.

I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.

HEADER_CONTENT Karen, I thought you guys were creating a manual invoice and sending it out the door. We can put all of this activity in our gas system for tracking and g/l purposes ( I think). I have not worried about it because I thought this activity was going away, or at least out of the Estate Team area where Robin Barbe and I work.

I keep wondering if this activity should go to Greg Sharps group (OpCo or New Co, whatever its called)?

The accounting contact at TXU is Mydra Derden and her number is 214-875-9473.

HEADER_CONTENT Chris, we prepared an invoice for Feb, but not for March or April, and somehow we still got paid. It's no problem for us to invoice TXU, though, if we need to. It's probably better that way, since it's not Enron that's getting paid here.

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow. I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far. Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this. But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should. I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need. I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this? Let me know. If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify? I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy. Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee. Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.

There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity. It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too. We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow. I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far. Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this. But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should. I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need. I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this? Let me know. If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify? I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy. Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee. Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

I think that it makes more sense if we send out our form to you. We have no
problem w/ the changes to force majeure, but most of the other issues raised
in the GISB will present problems for us. Specifically, we are unable to
agree to TX law, any arbitration, as well as spot price method of damages.
Additionally, it is of key importance to us that we have an order in place
w/ the bankruptcy court permitting both the contract, including the
transactions, and for Sempra to close-out and terminate any transactions in
the event that Enron converts its case to a Chapter 7. We would require the
GISB to have language referencing such an order.

I will ask our Contract Administration group to send this out today. I will
not be in the office this afternoon and tomorrow, but if you want we can
discuss on Friday.

310,000 dth x $2.47 per dth = $765,700.00

Goods and Services Tax $765,700.00 x 7% = $53,599.00

Total Bill = $765,700.00 + $53,599.00 = $819,299.00

I am not seeing this deal in Unify yet and that needs to happen so that GST will hit the GL. However, our tax department now knows we collected that tax and that it needs to be remitted to Canada.

HEADER_CONTENT Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.  Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will
1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada. Are there any special tax issues to address?

FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments? I hope we still have someone who can do that.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

I have combined the $40,000 and $70,000 on my worksheet but I'm not sure how my cash department will wire the funds. As of today, ENA has not purchased any swing supply on Trunkline Reliant and I do not anticipate very much activity on this deal.

HEADER_CONTENT Ed,

There was an outage on MOPS in Feb 2002 that impacted how much gas ENA received from Dominion (Louis Dreyfus deal #30468). We paid Dominion for 100,000 dth and we invoiced Tallahassee for 100,000 dth.  After the month was over, we discovered that we actually received 104,793 dth. We billed Tallahassee for the incremental volume and they paid for it. Is it ok to generate a payment to Dominion for the additional volumes [$10,334.67 = 4,793 dth x $2.1562]. Tallahassee paid us $14,570.72 for the gas [4,793 x $3.04].

If yes, I would like to have Phil show the payment of $10,334.67 to be made next Friday while I work on the cash request.

HEADER_CONTENT Kay/Tom,

I need legal and credit sign-off for ENA to pre-pay Reliant for gas needed to perform under the City of Tallahassee contract (approx $25 MM in the money to Enron).

The pre-pay would be for 2,000 mmbtu/day x 5 days x Gas Daily +.05 (appox $2.25) = $22,500

This would give us 5 days worth of swing gas pre-paid with Reliant.

Questions:
Are you concerned about Credit?
Are you concerned about the risk they may take our money and not perform by claiming an offset against other monies owed by ENA?
Kay, where can I find you to get you the contract to review?

Please get back to us today as we need to get the "Cash Approval Sheet" to the credit committee this afternoon.

Thanks so much,

Eric

PS- Chris is also working on another "back-up" supplier for this deal.

I do not have a concern about the credit quality of Reliant concerning this transaction.
Enron does have performance risk, but it seems minimal and I would recommend that we pre-pay Reliant the $22,500.

HEADER_CONTENT Ed,

There was an outage on MOPS in Feb 2002 that impacted how much gas ENA received from Dominion (Louis Dreyfus deal #30468). We paid Dominion for 100,000 dth and we invoiced Tallahassee for 100,000 dth.  After the month was over, we discovered that we actually received 104,793 dth. We billed Tallahassee for the incremental volume and they paid for it. Is it ok to generate a payment to Dominion for the additional volumes [$10,334.67 = 4,793 dth x $2.1562]. Tallahassee paid us $14,570.72 for the gas [4,793 x $3.04].

If yes, I would like to have Phil show the payment of $10,334.67 to be made next Friday while I work on the cash request.

ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million.

Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers, informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas.

I would think that we at least need to have a plan for advising the Court of any intention we have to try to terminate this contract for cause. I am concerned that the Court may take the following view: (i) Enron has just advised us that it values this contract at over $2 million, so it presumably it does not want to terminate it for nothing; (ii) under the terms of the contract, our remedy for non-performance is arguably the right to be made whole for our incremental costs of replacing the underlivered gas supply, rather than contract termination, and there is no indication Enron, as debtor-in-possession, does not intend to honor that obligation. We probably need Jason's input here, and in any event to proceed carefully before throwing down the gauntlet. Doug

Gentlemen,

Your company has failed to provide gas supply beginning tomorrow,
June 1st, and it is my understanding that Enron will not be scheduling gas
to Tallahassee pursuant to obligations of subject agreement for the entire
month of June. Moreover, it appears that Enron shall default same contract
for failure to perform, thus terminating the agreement. In any case,
Tallahassee would appreciate notification at your earliest convenience so
that we may make decisions regarding our energy supply alternatives.

HEADER_CONTENT Max,

Unify posted an update from Sitara for this Deal in Unify around 11:00 a.m. this morning. When I was checking the data pretaining to this deal in the database, I noticed that there is no volume data for March 2002 which is one reason why you can't produce a statement. Please get your Sitara contact to ensure March 2002 pricing data and volumes data exist in their system. If it does not, have them enter it and repush the deal.

I think it would make sense to add these deals into your system but I don't think it is a timing issue. It is the matter of cash inflows and outflows. Specifically, I don't want to be in the same predicament that we (the project) were in. I need the ability to receive payments directly to Ponderosa Pine and I also need the ability to send payments directly from the Ponderosa Pine account. By doing these two activities, I can monitor and approve the inflows/outflows of cash. By example - the recent TXU wire for February 2002 sales that was almost wired to Enron. Cash outflows - the Williams payment by Enron in November 2001 that has no FED ID# or breakdown of accounts.

In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms). Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties. Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691. This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer. The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00. Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice.

Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket? According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation.

One remaining question is whether we go in offering to pay demand charges for the total 2.5Bcf or only the 1.9+Bcf actually used during this period, given that the gas was trapped. The ratable amount is approximately $100k lower than the $575k in the letter. If for no other reason, from a negotiating perspective I believe we should go in with the lower number. Mark, do you have a view on this? If our legal analysis is clearly based on demand charges at the maximum volume, we probably should stay with the $575k.

REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Chip,

This e-mail confirms the info that we talked about this morning:

1) We found the old interruptible transport contract that is referenced in the firm storage agreement. It is a maximum rate transport contract that allows discounting of transport rates. I do not know what the maximum transport rate is for Bridgeline, but it is probably one rate for the entire pipeline. No active discounts were found in ENA's records. With the pipeline's cooperation, however, new discounts can be negotiated.
2) Under ENA's firm storage agreement, you must withdraw it from storage at the Storage Delivery/Redelivery Point which is defined as the interconnect between the storage field and Bridgeline Pipeline System. This means that some sort of transportation agreement on Bridgeline must be used if ENA does not sell the inventory in place.
3) Chris is making some preliminary calls to gauge the market interest for purchasing ENA's storage inventory. So far he has not received much positive feedback. As we discussed before, using an interruptible transport contract puts the shipper at risk that the gas will show up everyday and be available for sale to third parties. The price ENA receives from purchasers will most likely be discounted for this IT transport risk.

Good luck with the meeting,

According to our scheduled quantity logs, it looks as if a zero volume was nominated to Bridgeline companies after 12/3.

On the second cycle, the original on-time nominated volumes were reduced to zero, re-nominated and confirmed as zero. It would be a logical guess that Bridgeline told us to reduce our noms to zero....  The only way to determine if Bridgeline TOLD us to cut our nom., would be to pull tapes (if Christina had a recorded line)....

According to the Scheduled quantity log, the following was scheduled and confirmed in December 2001 on Bridgeline Gas Distribution, LLC for ENA:







On 12/3, it looks as if the same volume was originally nominated on time; then the receipt volume was reduced to zero on an intra-day basis; according to the scheduled quantity log, the delivered volume was not cut...this seems a little weird??; Zero quantity was confirmed for the remainder of December.

(ii) Greg Sharp is going to speak with McConnell this morning about obtaining the necessary support for buying the option;
(iii) Greg is going to determine all amounts currently owed (and past due) from Bridgeline to ENA;
(iv) we need you to help us confirm the amount of gas in storage (Hugh Connett suggested that their numbers show about 1.93 BCF);
(v) I am going to circle up with PWC and Blackstone (after hearing back from Greg) to talk about the deal and get their reactions; and
(vi) I am going to speak with Bridgeline on a preliminary basis about some of the deal terms (in particular (a) the option price, (b) doing the gas sale earlier and escrowing the proceeds, (c) mitigation of damages and how that mitigation should affect the amounts (both pre and post-petition) that are owed by ENA to Bridgeline and (d) increasing the amount payable for the gas in storage (because this deal is distinguishable from the pad gas sale in that we will be paying for the transport to move it)).

The main reason EES was able to negotiate them out, was EES did not record. EES prefers to have a written confirmation, does Wholesale?

Paul, since Wholesale records, I would think that the second special provision would apply, and the first one certainly could or could not, depending upon whether this is the practice of Wholesale. If this is merely Occidental's practice, then I will propose wording to change the reading to reflect that we do WANT all confirmations of less than one month to be confirmed.

The third special provision, can go either way, your call?

The fourth provision, seems fine, again your call?

Normally the pre-payment (by Occy) does not go in the actual GISB agreement. I would like to have Carol Wilson insert our bankruptcy language right before the signatures on page one.

Also, I would suggest under confirming party on page one, that it read: Enron Wholesale, unless you do not prefer to confirm, but I am pretty sure you do.

Let me know later.

Just to let you know, we rehashed the GISB yesterday and sent our final comments to Occidental yesterday afternoon. We have not heard back yet. We needed to make sure we had provided for the fact you do not record, you want them to prepay, no netting,setoff, etc. I also advised that ENA wanted to be the confirming party. Hopefully we will hear from them soon as I am sure they want to start the ball rolling as soon as possible.

Will you need my help with confirmations? I am glad to help you unless you have other sources, but we especially now need to have the written confirmations done, with the appropriate bankruptcy language.

Thanks again for your help.

HEADER_CONTENT Chip,

For the letter, we need to change the first sentence in Item #2 to the sentence given below. This should cover any storage volume differences discovered during our reconciliation and the 24,390 Dth imbalance gas that is due ENA on the transportation contracts.

2. Bridgeline purchases from ENA the final reconciled gas inventory stored under ENA's Firm Gas Storage Agreement with Bridgeline, currently estimated at 1,930,552 Dth, and the 24,390 Dth total imbalance gas that Bridgeline Holdings owes ENA under Transportation Agreements #96034592 and #96034796.

We will work with the Bridgeline accounting folks over the next few days to get the final reconciled storage balance. I will let you know ASAP.

HEADER_CONTENT Ruth,

With the adjustments made and the discrepancy that I found and will have corrected shortly, I am within 2 mmbtus of Bridegline's number. My balance for storage contract 96034600 is 1,930,554 mmbtus due ENA. My balances for contracts 96034592 and 96034796 are 18,178) mmbtus and 6,212 mmbuts, respectively, both due ENA. The diference in Enron's number and Bridgeline's number on contract 96034592 is 19 mmbuts I believe needs to be corrected on B/L's side. If you need any supporting documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

HEADER_CONTENT Rita,

Do you have a contact over at Bridgeline that you can call and get each of these balances reconciled? Ideally, ENA and Bridgeline need to have the same numbers. If we cannot agree, we will have to have Chip resolve the differences when he completes the deal.
REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I spoke with Doug Wilkinson who is the Controller over at Bridgeline and he confirmed his volumes on the firm contract (96034592) to be 18,159 due ENA and the IT contract (96034796) to be 6,212 due ENA. He is in agreement that these balances exists on these contracts and that these volumes are due ENA per their records as of today. I also mentioned to him that I knew where the difference was of the 19 mmbtus that we are off (August 2001, meter 843019).  If I need to do anything else, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Additionally, ChevTex has formally requested through Jayne that the accounting information be provided for their review. I agree with Mark Ellenberg's view that we should not provide this until we have agreement on the commercial deal. Jayne/Stephen, I would like to hear from you on this.

We need to huddle today to discuss our response to Randy's letter and keep the momentum alive. Given the LIP meetings this morning, can I suggest 3:00 this morning in ECN2829?

We have also offered commodity to Brdigeline at five cents under NYMEX for July. This new proposal is reflective of a conversation with Hugh Connett on Monday 6/11. We are resisting Bridgeline's claim to an additional month of storage due to the fact that had gas been released in January 2002, ENA would not have needed an additional month of storage for its gas.

HEADER_CONTENT Just a few comments on the new letter to Bridgeline:

In Paragraph 2, "reasonable efforts" can often lead to additional disputes when actually administrating the gas deal, such as price arbitrage between Bridgeline's price and the spot gas market prices. Could we add some flexibility to sell that inventory in-place to a third party so that additional fuel and injection fees will not be deducted from the third party's bid? Bridgeline waiver to other transport claims could be a problem unless Bridgeline just agrees to cash-out the transport imbalances at the NYMEX - $0.05 price, otherwise they will want us to transport at least the 6,212 Dth of interruptible transport imbalance gas to a delivery point. How about using the following:

...ENA will attempt to remove its gas from Bridgeline storage or arrange for an in-ground transfer of the storage inventory during the month of July....Bridgeline agrees to purchase residual gas and cash-out ENA's firm and interruptible transportation imbalances in accordance....

Also in Paragraph 3, instead of confirmation numbers the numbers are actually contract numbers (i.e. used three times).

The person that you mentioned this morning failed to make it to our meeting . Not a big deal but, as a result, I want to catch you up with where things are.

We established that:
(i) it is going to be very difficult to determine a fair market value for the put option;
(ii) Greg Sharp is going to speak with McConnell this morning about obtaining the necessary support for buying the option;
(iii) Greg is going to determine all amounts currently owed (and past due) from Bridgeline to ENA;
(iv) we need you to help us confirm the amount of gas in storage (Hugh Connett suggested that their numbers show about 1.93 BCF);
(v) I am going to circle up with PWC and Blackstone (after hearing back from Greg) to talk about the deal and get their reactions; and
(vi) I am going to speak with Bridgeline on a preliminary basis about some of the deal terms (in particular (a) the option price, (b) doing the gas sale earlier and escrowing the proceeds, (c) mitigation of damages and how that mitigation should affect the amounts (both pre and post-petition) that are owed by ENA to Bridgeline and (d) increasing the amount payable for the gas in storage (because this deal is distinguishable from the pad gas sale in that we will be paying for the transport to move it)).

Let's visit on this when you get a moment. Also please help me with item (iv) above. Finally, I need you to tell me if you are OK with how this thing is shaping up.

For the MichCon storage payment that is to be paid on 3/25, please change the note and delete that the payment request is still pending. I gave my stuff to Doug on Thursday night and Rita was finishing up the wiring form last night.

For the $5313 payment for the Bear Creek storage et. al. that is shown to be paid on 3/25, we need to delay the payment until we can resolve the pricing and volume questions with the pipeline. I recommend that it be delayed until say 3/29. There is a chance that the payment will be lower than $5313 once we get everything resolved. Is there a problem if the payment is reduced right before it goes out the door?

Since the volume is so small and does match the amount listed in TXOK it is highly possible that this an error.

A few pending questions regarding central transportation contracts.

1. PEPL and MRT contracts - Are these capacity release, agency, or do we own them? The ANR agreements indicate that we own those. The MRT agreements appear to state that they were released. If these are release contracts have they been recalled?

2. Can you provide the contact name and title, the address and the fax number for the ANR, PEPL and MRT. We need to provide notification of turn back for the contracts that we own.

Thanks a lot. Please let me know if you have any questions.

HEADER_CONTENT Okay, not sure who, if anyone, cares or needs to know BUT . . . .

Stingray Pipeline Company (34271) has been changed to Stingray Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (200104). This change created a new Global Counterparty number so it prompted manual changes to the Pipeline Name & Pipeline Counterparty data within Global Facilities. It also prompted the need to move (via assignment within Global Contracts) all service related agreements from the old GCP record to the new GCP record. I left both names on the Global Record, BUT due to system controls can only have 1 listed with the role of "Pipeline". This role was assigned to the "new" name & the old name (which is now a suspended GCP record) was made "Alternate Payee". This was a "guess" role - - - - and I have no idea of how the service side is impacted or at what level it validates the Global record attached to the deal. All contract services are the same on each record, but the role of "Pipeline" now resides with the new GCP.

Can you either let all those who need to know - - - know & let me know who/how should I share information like this in the future. You got a Transportation Greenie (just 'learned' how to change pipeline names today) over here.

HEADER_SUBJECT Pipeline Note ideas
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Attached are my first notes on Tennessee pipeline. RUTH, you need to read these notes and render and opinion <== that's an accounting term.

Of course all rules are made to be broken but here are some ideas

1. Put the notes in a word document and save it with the following naming scheme
Notes_(pipeline name).doc

Example ==> Notes_Tennessee.doc

2. Save the document under the pipeline directory,
o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/Transportation/(pipeline name)/Notes_(pipeline name).doc

Example ==> o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/Transportation/Tennessee/Notes_Tennessee.doc

Since we are just starting the process on most of the pipelines, we will need to create new directories for most of the pipelines.

3. At a minimum, put the date you are making the notes, I don't think the time is so important. I put in the time when its conversation, I just put in the date when I spend a couple hours working on something. Ha - me work a couple of hours!!

4. Put your initials at the end of the note so we know who made it.

5. When you put someone's name in the document, put their phone number and tell us who it is, at least the first time you mention their name if that person is not someone we all deal with. usually this would be the person your are speaking with at the pipeline. First person that comes to me and says "buy me a pop" gets $.60.

6. Last and certainly optional, I like to use the Comic Sans MF font because its more pleasing to the eye than the Times or Romans stuff but feel free to do your own thing.

Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation. According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001. Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months". The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible. Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!! So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal.

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn. Before I sell the gas, I will

1. verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
2. make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

FORWARD_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.  If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated" so it is not subject to the GST.

Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments? I hope we still have someone who can do that.

ENA sold the January gas for $2.755/Dth, the February gas for $2.385/Dth, and the March gas for $2.385/Dth. Jeff Hodge approved the original sale to CMS and was involved with negotiating with MichCon on this and a number of other matters.

ENA put up a $60,000.00 deposit to MichCon on January 10th to maintain our credit-worthiness and keep the storage agreement active so that ENA's storage balance could be sold to CMS. That deposit will be used to pay $20,950.00 of the total $35,300.00 February 2002 storage bill and $39,050.00 of the $39,050.00 March 2002 storage bill. Since Sylvia did not complete getting the storage payment authorization approved prior to leaving the company, this is now my mission.

ENA must pay the January 2002 storage invoice of $39,050.00 by March 11, 2002 or MichCon will suspend the agreement and will not accept any withdrawal nominations until payment is received. The storage agreement terminates on March 31, 2002. If ENA has a remaining storage balance at the termination date, MichCon's tariff allows the pipeline to cash-out the balance at Index minus $0.50 per Dth. If storage withdrawals are not accepted by MichCon after March 11th, ENA would also not be able to deliver volumes to CMS for the balance of the month of March and $2.385 million of sales revenues would be at risk.

Please approve:

$39,050.00 payment to MichCon by March 11, 2002 for January 2002 Storage Invoice
$20,950.00 payment to MichCon by March 24, 2002 for February 2002 Storage Invoice ($14,350 of deposit to be shown as invoice credit)

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure. There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out. I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco. Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169). I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day. Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.

I have 2 prepays in this email. We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8:40 AM tomorrow.

Note to all
The first prepay is to TXU. I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal.

The second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee. If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal. This is what we did on the 2nd-6th. I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th.

My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant. I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA. Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent. However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes. So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier. We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up.

Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company today filed a motion:
(a) to modify the automatic stay to permit termination of contracts or, in the alternative
(b) to compel debtors to assume or reject agreements; and
(c) to compel payment of administrative expenses.

Tennessee contends that debtors have not utilized the capacity reserved under various agreements since 12/01 (with minor exceptions) and have not paid the amounts due under those agreements. Tenneco is represented by F&J.

The amount allegedly owed to Tennessee that it requests payment as an administrative claim is $683,005.30. I do not believe that Tennessee filed a declaration to support the facts necessary to establish the amount allegedly owed as an administrative claim.

I reviewed the motion with Barbara Gray. She suggested I forward the motion to Kay Mann and Mark Ellenberg for their review and coordination with the Weil Gotshal counsel who dealt with the other transportation related motions. Fortunately, unlike the Southern and Columbia motions, Tennessee does not claim setoff and does not allege that it holds any gas owned by Enron-related entities.

We are sending this letter on Friday in an effort to adhere to a

intend tofile a motion with the bankruptcy court. Thus far, they have
not done so because we have been discussing a resolution of the issues
with them for the last few weeks.
That said, the letter will be sent only if it is consistent with the
final cmmercial call by Ed McMichael. Paying producers for deliveredgas
is ordinary course (per Mark E) but Ed is contemplating a BTRC review
anyway. If the commercial group decides not to pay DRI, this letter
would be revised to state that fact. I can reference the gas purchase
and sale agreement, there is only one such agreement between the
parties. The price is set forth in the agreement.
The purpose of the letter is to show DRI that we are not stringing them
along with requests that they not file in court, and no intention of
paying them. Trainor just wants something to give his client comfort
that he is not being suckered.

Pament for this gas for the period on and after December 3 is clearly
ordinary course, as both you and Ellenberg have noted. If we don't pay
for the gas, DRI will clearly be entitled to payment for the gas as a
priority administrative expense. Instead of sending the letter, doesn't
it make more sense just to pay DRI for all or a portion of the
post-petition A/R? (If I'm DRI, I'd rather receive a partial payment,
e.g. for a month or two of the seven months of A/R, than a letter saying
we are going to pay.)

If there is insistence on sending the letter, it should address the
following:

The specific price on which the payments be based;
A description of the contract which governs, with reference to
by parties, date, etc.;
The agreed payment date should be specified in the blank.

The letter itself will be a post-petition agreement of ENA to pay. Why
not just pay?

HEADER_SUBJECT Northern Border Stipulation Cliff Notes
EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Michael -- I recommend that you use the following as your Cliff Notes for the NBPL Stipulation:

Most of ENA's seven firm maximum rate transportation agreements with Northern Border Pipeline, NBPL, were used to ship gas purchased from Enron Canada, ECC, at the US/Canadian border to markets in the upper Midwest and Chicago. The gas supply for these ECC and ENA agreements was created by upstream "producer netback" transactions that ECC arranged with various Canadian producers. Producer netback transactions imbed the cost of transportation from the supply basin to the market area into the final price that the producer receives for its gas. Before bankruptcy, ECC's firm transportation on NOVA and Foothills and ENA's firm transportation costs on NBPL were ultimately paid by the netback producers.

The remaining ENA firm maximum rate transportation contract with Northern Border was entered into when the spread between the NNG-Ventura and an adjusted NGPL-Midcontinent indices allowed ENA to financially hedge the cost of the transport between the receipt and delivery points. These hedges are no longer in place and the spot market prices do not support keeping the contract for the Estate.

ECC is not in Chapter 11, however, most if not all of the producers involved with these producer netback transactions have the right to terminate under their agreements with ECC under certain defaulting events that ECC has indicated have occurred in the current operating scenario. Since there has been no gas sales to ECC, and no sales from ECC to ENA at the border, ENA's transportation on NBPL has not been used since the petition date. ENA's current reservation charges on NBPL are over $605,000 per month.

During ECC's settlement process with the NOVA/Foothills/NBPL netback producers, only one producer, Birchill, has indicated a willingness to acquire the NOVA/Foothills/NBPL transportation capacity related to its original deal. ENA's Northern Border Stipulation has incorporated the flexibility and features needed to have this capacity permanently released back to Birchill when the settlement is executed by the parties.

The Stipulation also contains ENA's recommendation that the remaining ENA contracts and capacity be rejected since the producer netback deals are dead and the financial hedges that ENA used to justify holding the transportation capacity are no longer in place.

Producer Netback Deal Structure

Netback Producers sell gas to ECC in the Alberta Province
ECC has firm transportation on Canadian pipelines -- NOVA and Foothills (Note: US and Canadian Transportation Costs are deducted from Producer's Price)
ECC ships gas to the US Border and sells gas to ENA at a pass through price
ENA has firm transportation on US pipeline -- NBPL (Note: US Transportation Costs are deducted from ECC's Price)
ENA ships gas on NBPL from the Canadian border to US markets and sells at US market area index prices

Call me and we can discuss,

HEADER_CONTENT Kyle,

We are presenting the Northern Border Stipulation at the Bankruptcy Transaction Review Committee, BTRC, this afternoon at 1 pm our time. The Stipulation that has been negotiated contains the features and time flexibility that ECC will need to complete the settlements with Birchill and/or Tenaska, that capacity has been carved out for special handling. It also means that the other remaining ENA capacity on NBPL will be rejected in two weeks. That also means that ENA will give up any other rights to the remaining capacity and that about 5 days later NBPL will be posting the space to find new creditworthy shippers.

The approach that I want to use today is that the Northern Border Stipulation is what we are discussing today. The Stipulation has the processes/flexibility incorporated the ECC needs to finis up your settlements. Your settlements should be presented separately and discussed in more detail. Could you guys be in position to talk to the BTRC on Tuesday?

HEADER_CONTENT Mark,

My reading of the 45 page settlement agreement, says that ENA agrees ... to release to Birchill "on a permanent basis on or before October 31, 2002". This wording gives us more flexibility than just saying the Birchill transaction is not going to become effective until November 1, 2002. It also matches up with Enron Canada's Birchill settlement which is how I discussed the issue with Eva.

I did a quick read of NBPL's Motion. Although, there was not a Schedule A in the Motion, it looks like the base contract for ENA's Tenaska temporary capacity release will be included in NBPL's Schedule A. Your comment to Len Parkins on the revision is on point.

Here is the Northern Border Pipeline draft stipulation that ENA is planning to present to the BTRC. It incorporates the flexibility and features that Enron Canada needs to complete settlements that are in the works with a couple of former netback producers, Birchill and Tenaska. It also has backup disposition plans for ENA's Northern Border capacity in the event that the Enron Canada deals fall apart. With respect to future claims, NBPL's posting of the capacity on their website is just another way to find creditworthy shippers that can step into ENA's shoes for the remaining terms of the firm max rate transport agreements.

HEADER_CONTENT Ruth,
I wanted to get back to you regarding the conversation you, Bill Fonda and I had the other day. We have discussed with management and the decision is that we would like to coordinate with ENA regarding the development of a protocol for the posting of the capacity ENA holds on NBPL.

In the current environment it appears that the best prices that will be obtained for ENA capacity will occur if the ENA capacity is released effective no later than June 1. If we can get the process approved and the capacity posted prior to that, so much the better.

I discussed with our bankruptcy counsel and he envisioned that NBPL and ENA would jointly agree to the protocol. That the protocol would be attached to a Motion with the bankruptcy court requesting approval of the protocol. And while that Motion was pending, present to the Creditor's Committee so that they would be on board in a timely fashion.

The goal would be that when the shippers are bidding on the capacity that they would be assured that the results of the bidding would not be subject to further approval by creditor's committee or bankruptcy court.

We are very interested in coordinating the development of the protocol as soon as possible. We will dedicate whatever resources necessary to complete this by the end of next week.  If you want me to contact an ENA attorney to begin legal coordination please advise. The name that I currently have is Kay Mann. If that is not correct please let me know.

If you have any other suggestions, please let me know.

Thank you.

HEADER_CONTENT This is NBPL's response to my suggestion that we need NBPL's input on the "Transportation Rejection/Acceptance Master Plan" for NBPL's pipeline that we are trying to get Creditor Committee approval. I view NBPL's protocol a process that the Creditor's could agree to prior to starting the automatic capacity release process. I suggested this overall approach in response as an alternative to NBPL notification that they are preparing a draft Motion compelling us to take action under procedures of the Bankruptcy Court

Although there is a few differences proposed by NBPL, overall it seems reasonable. We would need to work out a few details, including clarifying how to handle the Burchill capacity that involves Enron Canada's settlement.

I would like to contact Eva Neufield at NBPL to clarify the Burchill issues. Unfortunately, the Burchill capacity is a portion of the capacity included in Tenaska's FERC complaint filing. Legally, can or should I make any other contacts with NBPL until the FERC issues are addressed internally in more detail?

EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT My preference is to resolve the NBPL issues. Enron-Canada still needs some of the NBPL capacity permanently released to one of their producers with a another third-party designated as the agent for the contract. Oxy and some other folks have approached me about picking up some of the ENA space.

Please note that we were trying to get the transportation protocols approved by the Creditors Committee so that we could address (1) NBPL's insistence that the Creditor's approve everything and (2) the needs of the marketplace that once the capacity is awarded that it could be hedged without any additional Creditor approval. I know that we are making progress on the drafts, but how quickly do you envision this issues being presented to the Creditor's Committee?

NBPL wants the capacity placed with new shippers for June 2002 business. Ideally, this means that the new shippers should have the capacity released to them by Friday, May 24th. This means that the capacity would have to be posted on NBPL's website by the morning of May 20th. The schedule also assumes that the capacity release process is not stopped once it starts for Creditor's approval.

Kay, would it be OK if I called Eva and got a quick download on the results of the Tenaska complaint against NBPL that was filed with the FERC enforcement division? Do I need to have a lawyer listen in when I make the call?

HEADER_CONTENT MRT considers both of these contracts to be Maximum Rate FTS agreements. All current shippers on MRT receive a prorata share of the Settlement Discount. The pipeline completed that rate case settlement in November 2001. MRT cannot file another rate case for at least three years and is not obligated to file a rate case by a stipulated date. Therefore, for the remaining term of these agreements the Settlement Discount will be in place.

For K# 434:
Monthly Reservation w/ Settlement Discount is $15,811.58
Estimated Reservation Charges To Be Paid through End of Term is $411,100
( 26 months from Apr 02 through May 04 )
For K# 416:
Monthly Reservation w/ Settlement Discount is $2,238.48
Estimated Reservation Charges To Be Paid through End of Term is $69,400
( 26 months from Apr 02 through Oct 04 )

I also received the letter you requested that documents the particulars of EEM picking up the contract from PG&E Energy Services.

HEADER_CONTENT Recommendation for ENA Pools
1st choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition.
2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow
3rd choice Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.

I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck. Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone. When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel. I have not done that. I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.

Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following.
1. Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket.
2. ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition.
3. The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.

Items to consider
If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers. Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated. I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances. The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process. Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.

Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance. On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.

Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity. I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.

HEADER_CONTENT Hey team. I'm putting some high level information together about the Dominion Producers and I have a couple questions.

First, the worksheet.
I'm using the information Dominin Fed X'd to us 2 weeks ago.
Allocation Balance Report by production month. The monthy receipt volume net of fuel in columns B through D on the worksheet.
Imbalance Signoff Sheet by accounting month. The accumulated Dt Imbalance is in columns F through G on the worksheet.
Allocation Balance Report. The total adjustment quanity by contract by accounting month is in columns J through L on the worksheet.

Questions
1.  The Dec 2001 receipt volumes seem very low. I'm sure that high line pressure was keeping most of the production volume from flowing. Did we lose any producers between Nov and Dec, before the gas flowed?

2. I am assuming that most of this gas was priced at Index. Do you agree?


Let me know if you have questions. I'll probably have a few more for you two.

HEADER_CONTENT Sorry guys, I have more questions.

For Dec 2001, how many producers were supplying this gas for ENA? for EES? (doesn't have to be exact)

If possible, how many meter's are there supplying this gas?


I'm trying to put together information for the BTRC to show how detailed this activity is. If someone from the BTRC just looked at the total volume, the price we need to pay the producer, and the price we can get for this gas today, the BTRC may decide that we need to pay the producers and sale the gas.

HEADER_CONTENT Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01. From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01. That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market. However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.

Questions that need to be answered,
** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?



The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group. In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

HEADER_CONTENT Chris / Shemin / Ruth,

Here's a brief recap of what happened on the Dominion issues from the EES side. I would like to get an idea of where we stand with them now and make sure I coordinate with the ENA counsel and ENA's position with Dominion. Basically I want to make sure we address our "frozen" storage and decide how best to resolve the local producers issue ( when to pay and from what date ).

Basically the chronology from the EES is as follows :

Prior to Dec 2001, EES had storage capacity and Dominion transport released to us from Niagara Mohawk ( NIMO) for our customers behind that LDC. Over the summer of 2001 we injected approx. 680,000 dthms which should be worth $2.4 MM now.
Upon declaration of bankruptcy NIMO terminated our ability to serve customers behind the LDC as a result of the NY PUC ruling.
Also upon bankruptcy Dominion Transmission terminated all our transportation contracts including the transport for the storage capacity we had from NIMO. Dominion then took the position that our gas was frozen and could be used as an offset against the amounts we owed them.
Marshall Turner and Melanie turner of Weil Gotshal have been in discussions with the counsel for Dominion, Bill Saviers ( Internal ) Paul Vrana and Bruce Ruzinsky of Jackson Walker ( external )
One of the issues in dispute is whether Dominion can offset the value of our storage gas against payables due from ENA. I don't know if this has been resolved.

HEADER_CONTENT Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter.

Several gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool. They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers. Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them. I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests. Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships. Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below. I am sure more producers will call.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT The following motion was filed today, March 12:

Motion of Dominion Transmission, Inc. for Entry of an Order
(a) Granting relief from the stay so as to enable transfer of
gas stranded in pipeline to alternate pool operator; and

(b) compelling the debtors to pay Administrative Post-Petition
Parking Charges

Enron entities involved: EES and ENA

Hearing: April 4, 2002
Objection deadline: April 1, 2002
<<motion to lift stay.pdf>>
Summary of relief sought:
EES is a party to approximately 35 contracts with different natural gas
producers that utilize Dominion's pipeline to transport and store gas as
requested by EES. ENA is a party to approximately 236 contracts with
natural gas producers that also use Dominion's pipeline.

EES and ENA are parties to transportation and pooling agreements with
Dominion that expressly provide for use of Dominion's pipepline for gas
purchased by from the producers. Dominion alleges that EES and ENA
continue to use Dominion's pipeline because their gas purchase agreement
with the producers have not been terminated. Dominions contends that
the gas has been stranded on its pipeline and continues to accumulate,
but EES and ENA have not paid Dominion for "parking" or storage charges
or paid the producers for the value of the gas placed into Dominion's
pipeline. Further, ENA and EES allegedly have failed to move the gas
out of their pool by transfer or release the gas from the pool for sale
to another pool operator.

Dominion requests relief from the stay to transfer gas stranded on its
pipeline to alternate pool operators and to obtain payment as
administrative expenses the parking charges for gas stranded on the
pipeline.

Domion's only argument that the alleged parking services somehow
benefitted the estate is that ENA and EES have been able to hold natural
gas ready to deliver on short notice to various end users.

HEADER_CONTENT Here is the information that I requested from EES accounting on the value of the Dominion storage using the weighted average cost of gas approach. I am sure that I will be able to you to come around to my view of what NiMo's SC-11 tariff says.

I will also try to get documentation that confirms that when the storage volumes were assigned to EES that the wieghted average cost of gas approach was also used. EES believes that the market value of the NiMo storage volumes were significantly higher than the invoice price that was paid.

HEADER_CONTENT Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter.

Several gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool. They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers. Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them. I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests. Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships. Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below. I am sure more producers will call.

Thanks WRP

HEADER_CONTENT We (EES) have been getting December production payments ready -- what are your thoughts on actually paying the post-petition pieces?  Besides Dominion, we have producers off of Gatherco, Columbia Natural Resources,  Columbia Gas Transmission, Peoples Natural Gas, and East Ohio Gas.  Are these on your list to review some day like you are doing Dominion?   A few producers have called wanting to know when to expect payment and I just need to know whether to forge ahead to get caught up in getting their payments in the system, or to wait in case we have the producers taken out of our pools on all these pipes/ldc's.  It is a ton of work, and if it doesn't need to happen, all the better, but if it does need to happen, I need to be working on it now.
Also, only one company listed above could provide daily actuals so the others are just being split by 31 days.  I figured if the producer disputed his split (if paid), he could provide the back-up to make it more accurate.

Any comments will be helpful. Thanks.

HEADER_CONTENT Recommendation for ENA Pools
1st choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition.
2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow
3rd choice Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.

I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck. Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone. When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel. I have not done that. I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.

Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following.
1. Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket.
2. ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition.
3. The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.

Items to consider
If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers. Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated. I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances. The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process. Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.

Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance. On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.

Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity. I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.

I talked to Philip Bentley, Trailblazer's counsel, today. I told him that
Enron would not even consider the possibility of exploring settlement
unless Trailblazer turned over the proceeds of the capacity release that it
has been holding.  He said that he would relay that to his client.

Bentley left a message for me tonight. His message said that he had spoken
to his contact at Trailblazer and that "coincidentally" Trailblazer either
just has or is about to wire the final payment to Enron. Bentley said that
this was in keeping with "Trailblazer's practice of wiring portions of the
payments as they came in the door." He said Enron should either already
have the payment or should be getting it soon. He said that this appears
to eliminate the issue I raised with him today. He said that the "ball is
back in our court." He asked me to relay to Enron that this was no longer
an issue and let him know whether there is any interest in exploring
settlement.

Post Petition A/R Items + Interest:






Supposedly, TBPL has also sent Ed M. or Ruth a letter describing how things are going to be handled going forward. Neither Ed or I received the letter so I am asking that TBPL send it again. By now, ENA should have also received a wire for April business for about $176,000.

Since there is normally a payment lag, I recommend that TBPL immediately pay us $174,874.86 + interest that has been frozen by TBPL for the December and January post petition amounts. If the court comes back and agrees with TBPL's agruments, then TBPL makes an adjustment on the next invoice to ENA. It is about the same amount of money.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan. I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing an additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.



Chris's notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,  SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back.

HEADER_CONTENT Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat. This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract. Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it. I need to know;

1. What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2. What period do I sell the gas for? All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline? Or base load in April? I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3. How many bids do I need to get? I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4. This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas. I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.



2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,  SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.

Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.

Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal. Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled. Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID. Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it. She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination. I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.

HEADER_CONTENT Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting. Here are some items to consider,

1. Park balance on deal #1222 188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
2. Loan balance on deal #1424 (96,000) dth
3. ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
4. ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002. We have Dec 2001. Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please? Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002? I would be very surprised if they did.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract. Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it. I need to know;

1. What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2. What period do I sell the gas for? All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline? Or base load in April? I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3. How many bids do I need to get? I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4. This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas. I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.



2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,  SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back.

Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal. Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled. Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID. Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it. She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination. I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.

2. Loan balance on deal #1424 (96,000) dth
3. ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
4. ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002. We have Dec 2001. Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please? Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002? I would be very surprised if they did.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT We researched your question about how much money should we be paying SNG. This is what we uncovered about the "facts" that were represented by Sonat.

#1) The 92,949 Dth of gas that Sonat describes as the parked balance is really the net balance of 188,949 Dth of parked gas as of January 10th and an outstanding loan balance of 96,000 Dth. The loan was made to ENA in November 2001 with the understanding that ENA had a put option (i.e. ENA could pick when, where, and how much gas would be delivered to the pipeline on any given day) to repay the gas to Sonat anytime with the next year.

#2) January 9th was the last day that Sonat allowed us to withdraw our parked volumes. ENA's balance of parked gas on December 2nd was 266,241 Dth. On January 1st, ENA began withdrawing the gas to partially perform on a gas sales transaction to the pipeline. A volume of 8,588 Dth/day was withdrawn for 9 days, January 1st through 9th. When Sonat refused ENA's nomination to withdraw the parked volumes on January 10th, then ENA could then no longer partially make the sale to Sonat.

#3) ENA has invoiced Sonat for the 9 days of the partial sale to Sonat, a total of 77,292 Dth. To date Sonat has not paid ENA for the volumes of gas that was delivered. Had ENA been allowed to continue to withdraw from the parked balance the remaining parked balance on January 10th, 188,949 Dth would have been zeroed out by the end of January 2002 and an additional sales of 188,949 Dth would have been made to Sonat.

#4) The park transaction for ENA was done at a discounted rate that expired on January 31, 2002. Once again ENA's plan was to withdraw the parked gas so that park balance would be at 0 Dth when the discount expired.

#5) When ENA now tries to withdraw the parked gas, 188,949 Dth, or the net of the park and loan balance, 92,949 Dth, we need to have an agreement with Sonat on the rate that will be charged. The rate they may insist upon may be a combined withdrawal charge per unit and an inventory charge. Hopefully, they will be reasonable about these rates, since they were the ones that caused this problem in the first place.

If everything is thrown together, Sonat probably should be releasing our gas and paying us for the amounts due ENA.

Call me, so that we can go through each of these items,
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT There is one last item that I forgot to mention in my earlier e-mail:

#6) Before the petition date, ENA agreed to sell Sonat 310,000 Dth during the month of May 2002 at a price of $2.955 per Dth. Sonat sent ENA a letter terminating this deal on April 5, 2002. Please note that current May 2002 gas prices are significantly higher than the sales price and this deal would be a loser for ENA.

Dear Mark:

I received your voicemail concerning the parked gas and have discussed the
matter with our client.

It is our understanding that Enron owes Southern Natural Gas at least
$72,000 in parking charges under the relevant agreement for this parked
gas. This is separate and distinct from any other amounts owed to Southern
Natural Gas under any other agreements. It would seem appropriate that
Enron pay the amounts owed in respect of the parked gas.

We would be happy to discuss this with you, of course.

ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back.

Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal. Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled. Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID. Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it. She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination. I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.

HEADER_CONTENT Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting. Here are some items to consider,

1. Park balance on deal #1222 188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
2. Loan balance on deal #1424 (96,000) dth
3. ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
4. ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002. We have Dec 2001. Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please? Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002? I would be very surprised if they did.

HEADER_CONTENT Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat. This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations. The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract. Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it. I need to know;

1. What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2. What period do I sell the gas for? All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline? Or base load in April? I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3. How many bids do I need to get? I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4. This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas. I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.



2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,  SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule. AS (tariff sheet #205) and IPP
(tariff sheet #215) are separate rate schedules in the tariff. AS pools
are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a
specific geographical location on the pipeline. AS pool meters can be used
as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP
Pool meters are not.

HEADER_CONTENT columbia has been holding enron gas hostage since december. it refused to
honor enron requests to release the gas, asserting a freeze while
recoupment and setoff rights were figured out. this caused enron to lose a
sale of the gas that had been arranged at a time when the market was
favorable. subsequently, columbia unilaterally effected a recoupment and
filed a motion for setoff. columbia was holding the gas as bailee, just
like sng, and , thus, the sng ruling effectively blew them out of the
water. their response was to withdraw the old motion, set for hearing
today, and file a new motion. the new motion tries to get around the sng
ruling by arguing that title to the gas passed to columbia when the
agreements expired in december and january. of course, the only reason the
gas was still there is that they refused to let it out. i would consider
requesting rule 9011 sanctions on this one, but want to make sure that is
consistent with the "gestalt" of the case before doing it. let me know
what you think.

HEADER_CONTENT Ruth:
Rhonda Smith received a telephone call from Greg Williams regarding an asset which is still tied to Enron Energy Services. NYSEG released storage (contract # 65116) and pipeline capacity (contract # 71412) which are mandatory assets tied to supporting the retail markets behind NYSEG. These assets have not been released by Enron Energy Services and thus could be make us liable to post-petition damages and claims. The storage volume of 13056 dth must be resolved by March 31, 2002 as the amount will be liquidated by the pipe. NYSEG is no longer a market being supported by EES but I would like to take advantage of the high current market prices.

This brings up another question....has any of the EES capacity been released back to the pipe, especially those assets which are currently not being used to support 'keeper' markets? Please contact me regarding the status of this progress and what needs to happen to expedite resolution to paragraph one.

Motion for Entry of an Order (1) Modifying the Automatic Stay to Permit Termination of Contracts or, In the Alternative (2) Compelling Debtors to Assume or Reject Agreements

Debtor: ENA

Deadline: June 10, 2002
Hearing: June 13, 2002

Summary:
This is yet another motion by a pipeline to terminate its contracts with ENA or compel the assumption or rejection of the contracts. The arguments are substantially the same as those made by other pipelines. We were informed by Colorado's counsel (who is the counsel of record on other pipeline capacity motions) that this motion was forthcoming.


And for those who are interested, attached is a copy of the bankruptcy court's bench opinion on the Milbank disqualification motion. The motion was denied.

HEADER_CONTENT Motions
We just found out that National Fuel Gas Supply, NFGS, filed motions with
the bankruptcy court on December 18, 2001 to (1) vacate the automatic stay
and allow NFGS to terminate the firm and interruptible transport
agreements, (2) compel the Debtor to assume or reject the agreements, or
(3) provide adequate assurance of future performance by the Debtor. A
separate motion for ENA and EES was filed. The hearing looks like it was
scheduled on January 3, 2002.
I do not believe that ENA's and EES's commercial groups were aware that
these NFGS's motions had been made to the court. Was Legal involved in a
response to these motions? If ENA and EES did not respond at the court
hearing, is the decision of the court to terminate the agreements?
Most of the agreements were for interruptible services that had no future
value to the Estate. One of the two firm ENA agreements was tied to a
"producer netback" transaction that Enron Canada is working on a settlement
with the producer. The other firm ENA agreement is out-of-the-money and
would have been rejected anyway.
Please confirm that by ENA and EES taking no action at the hearing that
the agreements have been terminated. I will get with Enron Canada so that
fact can be included in their settlement with the producer.
Thanks for your help,

Did we do this for March...I don't remember...
REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT We did release it for March, but there is a revenue sharing mechanism in place because TW released the space for us.

The normal demand charge on the contract is $.06 per day. For March, TW released the space at $.102 and TW gets 50% of the revenue from the release which is calculated as  (.102 - .06) x 50% = $.021.

ENA's effective demand charge for March is (.102 - .06) x 50% +.06 = $.081 which is the rate we put in sitara #1199508. We were not sure how TW would show this on the bill for March.

I also changed the demand charge calculation on deal 1190537 (this ticket records the demand charge as and ENA expense). It was taking the demand rate of $.06 times 700,000 dth per month. I changed the volume to 25,000 dth per day.

The details of the deal and my discussions with TW are given below. Please send him the wiring instructions so that we can get the money in the door.

Please note that there will also be payments made to ENA under K#24924 for February and March 2002. The good news is that invoice credits will be very clear for Feruary and March, since the deals were done for the entire month.

CAPACITY RELEASE REVENUE SHARING TRANSACTION

ENA and Transwestern agreed to share the revenues generated in releasing ENA's TW capacity in excess of our discounted rates on a month-to-month basis. The agreement also requires that TW release us from claims if the capacity is released at rates below ENA's contract rates. As a result, only K# 24924 (i.e. the San Juan contract) has been released to a third party.

Transwestern was able to release the 25,000 Dth/d of Ignacio to I/B Link capacity at $0.065/Dth for January 11-31 (i.e. 21 days). Since our discounted rate is $0.06/Dth, ENA should receive 50% of $0.005/Dth, or $0.0025/Dth, for the 21 day period. Transwestern's invoice for January 2002 business showed that a $13,687.50 payment is due Transwestern. This amount was calculated from a credit of $0.0625/Dth for 21 days offsetting the $46,500 monthly charge. Another way to calculate this amount is that ENA's portion of the capacity release revenue sharing, $1,312.50, was netted against the $15,000.00 pipeline charges for January 1-10.

ENA's position is that the agreement entitled ENA to receive the revenue sharing of $1,312.50 as a cash payment during the normal billing cycle, and that the other $15,000 should be addressed during the bankruptcy claim process. I discussed this issue with Paul Y'Barbo at Transwestern on February 15th. He followed up with me on February 20th that ENA will be paid the $1,312.50 as soon as Transwestern receives payment from the outside party that picked up ENA's capacity. TW thought that payment from the third party would be received in a "couple of days".

HEADER_CONTENT cc:

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool
EMAIL_END 
FORWARD_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
Phillips  Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you
can anwser this.

If I buy onshore, take it through mainline, take it through leach, and take
it to a delivered gate on TCO. Do I just pay GRI once at TCO delivered
point. If I drop it off in TCO pool, then I pay the GRI there?? I can't
seem
to get a straight answer from my accountants and TCO. It looks like our
model is adding the GRI at each leg... opps.

Thank you sweetie!!!!

How's your bidweek... mine sucks!!!

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT September 22, 2000

To:? Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and
Shippers

Re: Transco Files a Motion for Modification of Settlement to
??? Permit Interim Partial Refunds
??? Docket Nos. RP97-71-000 and RP97-312-000

In response to certain customers' requests, Transco submits a
Motion for Modification of Settlement to Permit Interim Partial
Refunds in the above-captioned proceedings. By this motion,
Transco requests that the Commission modify Article V of the
January 20, 1998 Stipulation and Agreement to permit Transco to
make an interim partial refund of amount to Non-Contesting
Parties, if any, related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return
Issues on or about October 31, 2000. The refund is being made to
parties in advance of the date that such refunds are due as set
forth in the Stipulation and Agreement, in part to help mitigate
the effects of current high natural gas prices on their
customers. For further detailed information of the Motion filed
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, please refer to
Transco's filing today in the above mentioned dockets.

Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on
or about October 31,2000 to Non-Contesting Parties related to the
Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to
those customers with interest from the date of payment to the
date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May 1, 1997
through February 29,2000 in excess of the amount that would have
been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the
Commission's findings in its March 17, 2000 order in Docket No.
RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues,
subject to the "refund floor". These interim partial refunds will
be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any
supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for
the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon
request.

If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim
partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final
Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital
Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds
related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non-
Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on
or before October 25, 2000, of its election not to participate in
the interim partial refunds.

Chris,

1- According to EES, the price on deal #116090 should be CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I
+0.014. However, Sitara shows the price index is CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I +0.032.
Could you please verify which rate should I be using in billing EES?

2- On deal #156406, I was told by Judy Barn that this is an internal
(financial) deal, therefore, it did not get downloaded into Settlement.
However, per Patricia Downey at EES, this is a financial deal that was turned
physical. Would you please also confirm this wherether we should bill EES
for this deal or not?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Unless I'm missing something, it does not appear that there is a way for us
to run a CPR report that shows all business done on a particular pipe
regardless of desks. For example, if I want to see all business that is
being done on Transco, I must run the report for both the Northeast desk and
the Market East desk. This next weekend, the east is to be split into 12
different desks, which will only complicate the issue even more.

Russ Severson has the position screen set so that all business will roll into
one position manager. Is there any way that we get something similar from
the reporting environment. I'm thinking that the easiest way might be to
have the ability to select just a pipe without being forced to select a desk
first when submitting a report.

Subject: TRANSCO PROPRIETARY FILE

Dave,

As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES
contracts as well
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union. Our proprietary file contacts the
business party id, rather
than the DUNS number. Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's
business party id. These
are the valid business parties we use:

ENA  5304
Brooklyn Union  21995
Columbia Energy Services 5092
Columbia Energy Marketing 7772

As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various
producers, we will
need to include their business parties as well. For now, this is all we
need. In the meantime,
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert
into Unify as do not
send??

Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking. We spend a
great deal of time
overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity to
be cut as we need
it. Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swing
activity to 899??

Thanks for you help.

Chesapeake Energy stock being sorely undervalued
2001-02-25
By Melissa Davis
Business Writer

Ask the experts. Chesapeake Energy is more than a $9 stock.
Forget that Chesapeake is up more than 200 percent from a year ago -- and up
more than 1,000 percent from its lowest days, not long ago, when it traded
for less than $1. Chesapeake still appears sorely undervalued.
Last week, Chesapeake announced record fourth-quarter earnings that were
1,736 percent higher than earnings for the same quarter in 1999. The company
also reported a 2000 net income of $3.52 a share -- which means you can buy
Chesapeake for a price that is less than three times the company's earnings.
"No stock trades for three times earnings," said Mickey Thompson, executive
vice president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. "The
independent producers are all undervalued right now. Chesapeake is just the
most undervalued."
Chesapeake is the 10th-largest independent producer of natural gas in the
country. And natural gas, because of low supply and high demand, is one of
the hottest commodities on the market. It's a huge money maker.
So Chesapeake is in the right business at the right time -- and it's into it
heavily. Natural gas accounts for almost 90 percent of all the business that
Chesapeake does.
This has already caught the attention of some prominent investment experts.
Chuck Clough has picked Chesapeake as one of his favorite companies in his
current favorite sector -- natural gas. And Clough isn't just anybody. Until
a year ago, he was chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. Shortly
after he left, he established a hedge fund that returned 17 percent, after
fees and costs, during an 11-month time period when the rest of the market
slid -- and the Nasdaq tumbled 44 percent.
Clough's young hedge fund now boasts $150 million in assets.
He's not too worried about falling natural gas prices. He's invested 32
percent of his portfolio in energy stocks and most of that in natural gas.
He's convinced that companies like Chesapeake will begin trading for much
more than two or three times their earnings -- and soon.
Stephen Smith, a Houston analyst for Dain Rauscher Wessels, considers
Chesapeake to be a top performer among the energy companies he covers. He is
convinced the stock is undervalued and that -- even after gaining 326 percent
last year -- Chesapeake will have another banner year in 2001.
"Natural gas prices don't have to stay at $7, $8, $9 or $10 for them to have
a good year," Smith said. "The prices could drop to $4 or $5, and that would
still be a wonderful doubling of what they used to be. If we can continue to
see $4 gas prices, then I think that energy stocks -- and particularly
Chesapeake -- will start to respond a bit more."
Thompson, who moves within local energy circles, is very optimistic.
"The natural gas prices we lived with for most of the '90s will never come
back," he said. "I can see a scenario with $4 and $5 gas prices for a long,
long time."

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to

Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost

Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. However, we
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples

Questions that I have:
1) I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.) This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production. If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.

2) If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3) Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?

4) If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will

Subject: Re: PNG Local Production July 00


Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300
day from Phillips Production. That works out to about 429 day.

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be
4,000 for the month.

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it, CNG scheduler) has
agreed to help out any way she can. She knows escript pretty well. Chat
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure
out how to run all the reports we need back to January. Also, we will not
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to
Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool
gas.

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Subject: PNG Local Production July 00


Hi Paul and Chris,
Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month. Did you guys do a deal for this gas too? He usually nominates
it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do
it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th). I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was
not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out
there
yet.
I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do. Just give me the word and I
will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is
the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it. Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k. How does the grass look up at
Dad's. I am thinking we should maybe bale the hay. I have intentions of
going up there this coming weekend. You should have bought a boat during
the boat show. I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him
about a boat. Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat? Freshwater or
Saltwater. I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha. A friend of mine
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston
Whaler. I think the boat was around 21/23 '. The sides were approximately
6/8" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directly
behind that which served as a seat. It also had what I call a jack plate on
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom. He
could run in about 8" of h2o. If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150
horse Yamaha. That baby would fly. They are bay boats but Aubrey took his
out in the Gulf frequently. You should call Duane Davis. I bet he can find
you exactly what you want.

Examples:

GW earnings report on 2/12 price = $6.70, by 3/1 price $5.05.

DNR earnings 2/23 price + $11.00 by 3/1 $9.70
CRK earnings 2/14 price = $13.80 by 2/20 $10.20

Hi. Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st. I had requested 145 dth per day on
Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler. For some reason Chris
Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth. PSNC
called
me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled. I instructed PSNC to
contact Chris. Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth
on
the first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second. I did this.
This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March
1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed. I called my transco scheduler and
she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled.
(impossible as capacity was released to Enron). All I wanted was 145 dth per
day for March. Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what should
and did get scheduled? Thank you.

I just left Cingy a message - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance
trades that we intiated. However, it could have been done by CES or EES. I

issue. She can be reached at (703) 317-2293. Can you please get back to me

Effective March 1st, I moved the volumes on deal 377268 (Non NY sale to New
Power) to deal 643754 (sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS). Please correct the
hedge information.

I also created deal 643761 (sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS). I believe
this deal is in the index book but does not show up in Sitara. I believe it
was originally a Z6 Non Ny sale to New Power also.

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn.
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro.
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend.
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to
cause unnecessary pain.

NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION:


In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk
will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas
rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.

If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk
last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara
Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity
to
you. However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an
Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG
capacity to you.  The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March,
2000. Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of
April.

If you have any questions, please call Dennis Bartlett at 315-460-4042 or me

and
we will know that on Thursday.  The number on the attached spreadsheet is our

Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day


Computer Gender

An English teacher was explaining to the students
the
concept of gender
association in the English language; noting how
hurricanes at one time were
given only female names, and how ships and planes
were
usually referred to
as "she." One of the students raised her hand and
asked,
"What gender is a
computer?"

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class
into two
groups:? males
in one, females in the other, and asked them to
decide if
a computer should
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked
to give
four reasons for
their recommendations.

??? The group of women concluded that computers
should be
referred to as
masculine because:

1. In order to get their attention, you have to
turn them
on.

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.

3. They are supposed to help you solve your
problems, but
half the time,
they ARE the problem.

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that,
if you
had waited a
little longer, you could have had a better model.

??? The men, on the other hand, decided that
computers
should definitely be
referred to as feminine because:

1. No one but their creator understands their
internal
logic.

2. The native language they use to communicate
with other
computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else.

3.? Even your smallest mistakes are stored in
long-term
memory for later
retrieval.

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you
find
yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.

Is there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market
area pipes to the Market East p&l? If the only reason is that you're not
sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion. It seems to me that there are
only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee,
Texas Eastern and Transco. For now, why don't we leave all the demand
charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the
East p&l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East
book: Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG,
Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel.

Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

Technology has helped Enron create new businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com. You =01,ve seen what technology can do at work. Now we want you and your family to realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t he ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips.
We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000 software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries; however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT , Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business reasons. Eligibility includes being employed at the time of implementation. ? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter. Delive ry of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized. To address some of your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on http://clickathome.enron.com. We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne ar future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.
We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your family. We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve l by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe Enron is a great place to work.

Subject: CKY 6-12 January 2000 - cut 29th 767 dth

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.  However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.  They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.   When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.  I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.  I
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.  I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.  I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.  She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.  She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).  I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.  However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.  I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short, we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).  Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.

book since there is flexibility in the takes. Also, he said he has a strong

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked. You can do what you want, but
I still think we should book it. The flexibility in takes is only 10% so
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't
book anything. Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to. In addition, per our
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year. This
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term. And finally, what if
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you
want.

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999. (Applause
here!) Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled via a manual line item.

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type. For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity. Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting. Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close. The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31. This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara. Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month. For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator. They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
forward.

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting... Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1. We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for
production months older than 12/1999. This allows us to focus our efforts on
current month. Per Bryce, applaud here!

2. Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3. Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4. Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator. Changes should be made
effective 12/1999 production forward.

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions. If
necessary, please forward to your teams.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost

Heidi
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. However, we
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples

Questions that I have:
1) I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.) This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production. If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.

2) If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3) Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?

4) If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
Phillips  Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you
can anwser this.

WGL (Shenandoah Gas) is under gas in/gas out restrictions through Monday.

Please bring in an extra 128 dth/day for 1/20 through 1/24 to CES EU. For
today I've talked to WGL and we can bring the extra in on Cove Point.

Per my voice mail please let me know that today's increase will flow as soon

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2: The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue. Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3. Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.  Here is what is happening: Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.  We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers. So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items. That's problem one. Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations. We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want). For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.  I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4. Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you. Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges. This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. Let us know what
you would prefer. Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29. Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7. I apologize for the delay.

5. Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday. Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
balances.

You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these

If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities
are the same now. In Jan, the "true backhaul" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was
$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges. We actually did
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until
October, after the summer period?

Shawna,
I am Isabel and I work in Gas Settlements. Could you help me out with the
following?

Deal # 233091 for Bay State is charging a demand charge every month.
Accourding to Bay State Enron should not be charging demand charges. Could
you let me know if this correct. Should Enron be charging demand charges?
Maureen Smith is down as the trader on the deal. However, I am not sure if
that is correct. Please let me know if you are not the correct person to

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type. Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

3) Please confirm that your model type is always "P" pathed from noms all
the
way down to invoices.

Our model type is always "P" for pathed.

HEADER_CONTENT I have been speaking with Sylvia Campos on this. Originally they wanted to
do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a
different service type (so as not to change historically). To my
recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was
cleared with Connie Sutton. So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible. For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it. I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one). Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up. I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please
advise.

HEADER_CONTENT Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1. Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after
paying the transport cost. However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the
prices listed below. For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone
SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou. The total transport cost is $.02
(including demand - this changes each month). We don't arb the supply with
Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this
is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid
price and the transport expense?

Colleen,

Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling
daily:

CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16
CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their
intra-month curve at.
TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10

Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one
day lag. After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any
derived curves.

Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as
possible. This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible. I'm not sure how you or
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating
transport p&l. In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas. These could
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates. The
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES
business in our portfolio, the times have changed. Currently we are using
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and
how we are marking the curves. For example, today's Gas Daily postings
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY  GAS DAILY SPREAD  SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985  $1.565   $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39  $ .585   $.16
CNG South $3.305  $ .670   $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong. There are
two solutions that I see. One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace. That's up to you.
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it),
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

HEADER_CONTENT In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John
Singer). Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package. I'm assuming
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point,
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the
Wholesale package. If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours
and are, presumably, CES Retail. If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to
Enron.

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or
not. Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES? This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are
TCO deals. I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points. We found a few like
this on CNG last week. The way we have been handling this is to show a buy
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right
now he's priorities are just a bit different. I guess why I'm a little
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal? If it's
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

The offsetting dollar amount for the 9612 production adjustment
(K#016-21045-306C) was $121,080.16. This adjustment however was reversed
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in
11/97 GL and subsequently written off in 01/98 GL at the time the company was
sold. I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it.

I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we are
going to make to Co.366 ($463,609.20) and the actual dollars in the system
($498,824.82). He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct.

Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what
the amount would be. Thanks,

Subject: Enron Louisiana Mtg. 8/3

I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday. Tracy is expecting
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production
month adjustment. What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2) pass it through to
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3)
cut a check to Trans Canada? Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00? I believe it depends on
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

Elizabeth... Can you tell us if the terms of the Formosa Plastics/Sport
Pipeline deals have changed? The terms USED to be Formosa got the first
15,000/day (deal 229875), Sport deal #244626 got the next 5,000/day and Sport
deal #244627 took the swing. There have been new deals set up in Sitara for
November production that don't mirror that. Formosa deal #463959 starts on
day 4 (what happened to days 1-3?) and gets the first 15,000/day. Sport deal
# 456694 covers days 1-3 but the prices are tiered to include what looks like
Formosa's volume. Sport deal #463958 covers the rest of the month but the
prices don't mirror the first 3 day's prices. Do you see a problem here??!!

Help!!

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999. (Applause
here!) Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be
handled via a manual line item.

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date,
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type. For example, if you are
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity. Same
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting. Any
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close. The Rates team will
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31. This should allow you time to
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within
Unify/Sitara. Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and
reversed by the end of the same accounting month. For items that have been
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management
coordinator. They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production
forward.

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by
the end of 2/2000 accounting... Once the numbers booked in Unify are final,
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT cc:

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa
EMAIL_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2: The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month
changes does appear to be an issue. Since the contract didn't spell out in
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location. I know Chris
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie. I will ask that he forward
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP. Let me know if
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3. Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms
here.  Here is what is happening: Your people are nominating this
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations),
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction. That
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.  We are
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual
contract prices with the producers. So, this is one issue we will have to
address as indemnification items. That's problem one. Problem two is that I
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all
the nominations. We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is
what you want). For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.  I'll
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4. Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the
pipeline invoices on to you. Maybe we should change this process to one
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his
confirmation and review of all the charges. This means you may see quite a
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something. Let us know what
you would prefer. Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to
your office yesterday, March 29. Chris will get all remaining demand charge
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7. I apologize for the delay.

5. Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on
Monday. Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you? If not, please
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory
balances.

this being along all the streets surrounding the house as well as the
volleyball courts at Bubbas. Park wherever you can.

Please see the attached map or go to Yahoo Maps for assistance. It works
well if you use 1380 Utah St. (Don't ask why)  Please pass this on to
others that I may have overlooked. Call if you have any questions.

Subject: National Fuel Says They Are Pathed Model Type

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type. Our Unify
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like
we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type
manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter
the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

EMAIL_START 
HEADER_CONTENT Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000. As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know. I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss. Below is a brief description of each. Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips
Production. The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool. It will cost
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer. If Paul Leanza can use
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool

Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st? If
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July. However, we
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Subject: Re: Peoples

Questions that I have:
1) I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool. It
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these
types of noms.) This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas
behind the gate and we don't need more production. If the customer can't
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will
only make my pool longer.

2) If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3) Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?

4) If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with
PNG.

Subject: Re: Peoples

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company. This volume is will be decreased until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule). There
are 7 Phillips meters in CES's pool beginning July 2000. Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved. EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2. See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note: PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system. Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure. Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1. Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer
that can take around 1,000 day. I don't know if that's dt or mcf. I will
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me. This customer has a
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the
customer pulls. For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf
credited back to your imbalance account the following month. I don't know
how this works with trading imbalances. But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works
out to $.21 - sounds good to me. Paul said this customer is looking for a
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number. Marde will not sell at
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,
settle up financially with EES and be done with it. What we could do to test
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for
July. It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.  AND, have EES
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing. Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1. Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's
pool. Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?
If yes, how many meters?

2. Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
Phillips  Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to
EES's pool for July. Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer. At what price will
you take these deals? I assume we need to get this info from John before you
can anwser this.

HEADER_CONTENT We sold directly to Clinton for the term of our deals. Clinton (Latrove)
should have pulled directly from Power Gas Marketing's pool. The Power Gas
Marketing supply deal ends Oct 31st and the local production deal ends Nov

HEADER_CONTENT It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen. We recogniz e that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w e are pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success through Enron stock options.
As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t he All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu e to participants through 2000. Employees who have participated in this program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the program.
Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued success. Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid ed to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib le on that date (please see note below). The new program, which is subject to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran t of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O ption Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program. To provide information and answer your question s, we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular basis. In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo ur Human Resources representative.
Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant ing of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal regulatory requirements. It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enr on companies=01, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor or business issues. As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the marketplaces we serve. Given that need to change, we will continue to refi ne the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being determined on December 29, 2000.

David, Sea Robin Pool is a zone on the Sea Robin Pipeline (SEAR). The Sea
Robin Pool zone includes many different meters some of which do have a prefix
of ISRP. However, there are also other meters in that zone that have the
following prefixes: LSRP, FSRP and PSRP. I mapped the entire zone to the new
curves you sent us. Given your message it seems like things might not be
peachy after all if you only wanted the ISRP meters mapped that way. Please
call me as soon as you get a chance.

REPLY_END 
REPLY_START 
HEADER_CONTENT I think the best thing to do would be to create a separate zone for all of
those ISRP meters. The traders typically take deals from ISRP to the Pool
and incur transport. Therefore having two zone would more accurately
represent what is actually happening.

I am in London helping Brent Price with some audit work that he is doing.

Subject: Re: Sea Robin Well Head Curve

Well, whenever we map specific meters on a zone to curves that are different
than what the entire zone is mapped to, we create an alternative facility
mapping for each specific meter that you want mapped differently. Currently,
there are 137 active meters on the Sea Robin Pool zone with a prefix of
ISRP. That would mean I would have to create 137 alternative facility
mappings. Another alternative would be to have all of those meters moved to
their own zone and then just create one mapping for that whole zone.
However, this will also take a great deal of time, since Global Facilities
would have to change the zone on every single facility record. Plus, we
would have to see what type of activity is on all of these meters and we
would have to update the zone on all of these deals after Global Facilities
made it's change. So, let me know what your thoughts are. What are you
doing in London???

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible. For your information,
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and
prices in it. I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10%
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided
to us by CES.

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc. Anyway,
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in
by your group (I think you're the right one). Again, those deals should be
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you. In addition, I
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass,
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things
are matching up. I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please
advise.

We have WV produced TCo. To my knowledge we have no Mountaineer. CES never
wanted to buy Mountaineer production because of the daily balancing for both
the production and the end-user side.

FYI
Based on a request by Dennis Bond, a new report has been added that allows
external customers to see the group, name, and description for all reports
that
they can run. The report is called RPT_GROUPS_EX (group Reports), and can be
run by internal users as well. Only reports that are available to all
external
customers are included, so company specific reports will not be displayed.
Currently the report is 10 pages, and does not include a data file
(description
can be up to 200 characters, and doesn't fit well into a spreadsheet). Dennis
wanted to be able to give new customers something to help them get started
with
the various billing report options. Since showing all reports didn't require
that many pages, thought it might be helpful to include everything. Good
idea!

HEADER_CONTENT Vince and Vasant:

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for
overhead expenses. A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 . The trader's spread is
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity.
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet). For South Texas and
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc). And, once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges. We actually did
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until

"Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they

Steve Rafferty, 412-395-3268.

Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective
12/1/99. On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal
141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake. I don't see a sale anywhere to
FirstEnergy.

Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day.

Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240)
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had to tranfer the
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at
Friday's P&L. This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday resulting in taking the
Sunday's gain away from your book.

Let me know if we need to discuss further. thanks.


Kimat

We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM. All we are doing

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago,
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented
capacity. Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement
shipper. Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not)
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible. For instance,
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on
Iroquois' system? Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments
on this issue. I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

Thanks.

our Canadian term supply. We typically transport to markets off Iroquois, to
Tennnessee pipeline and CNG pipeline. That is a simplified summary of our
daily activity on Iroquois. If you need any information, please let me
know.

Hi team. Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade
behind NIMO. As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go
away but its not working. So, this is what I need to know;

Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr
2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

I just left Cingy a message - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance
trades that we intiated. However, it could have been done by CES or EES. I
asked her to call me back.

HEADER_CONTENT Ernie, this is what I think. ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO
citygate. I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did
with Peoples and East Ohio. Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because
it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.

Comments, questions?

I just spoke with Jim Scabareti at AGL regarding the releases of capacity.
AGL/VNG is fine with your proposal to release the assets for three years
provided the releases are recallable for any reason. This recall right is
consistent with our asset management agreement (which basically determines
the nature of recall rights AGL has under our deal)

So....

Go ahead and release the assets, 100% recallable, for three years.

If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool).
If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me. Metered production
or pool gas on CNG?
